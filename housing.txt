Sales of previously owned homes dropped 145 pct in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 347 mln units the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said But the December rate of 406 mln units had been the highest since the record 415 mln unit sales rate set in November 1978 the group said The drop in January is not surprising considering that a significant portion of December's near-record pace was made up of sellers seeking to get favorable capital gains treatment under the old tax laws said the NAR's John Tuccillo of new single-family homes in the United States fell 68 pct in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 716000 units the Commerce Department said The department revised downward December's sales to a 121 pct rise to 768000 units from the previously reported 127 pct increase The January decline in sales was the largest since last October when sales fell 93 pct Before seasonal adjustment the number of homes actually sold in January was 53000 up from 49000 in December but down from 59000 in January 1986 The January fall brought home sales to a level 16 pct below January 1986 when they were a seasonally adjusted 728000 units The average price was a record 127100 dlrs surpassing the previous record 119100 price set in December The median price of a home in January reached 100700 dlrs -- the first time the price has exceeded 100000 dlrs That compared with a median price of 94600 dlrs in December and 94000 dlrs in January a year ago New homes available on the market in January totaled a seasonally adjusted 362000 units unchanged from December and equal to a 63 months' supply The supply in December was 59 months by the non-residential sector Canadian building permits issued in November rose 07 pct to 218 billion dlrs seasonally adjusted from 216 billion dlrs in October Statistics Canada said Residential permits fell 39 pct to 125 billion dlrs from 130 billion dlrs in October while the number of units approved fell to 17552

1888 mln in December the Commerce Department said The January fall came after a strong 64 pct rise from November's rate of 1774 mln units and brought completions to 67 pct above the January 1986 level of 1765 mln units In January completions of single-family units rose 04 pct to a seasonally adjusted 1183 mln units from 1178 mln units in December while multi-family units fell 13 pct to 701000 units

December while multi-family units fell 13 pct to 701000 units in January the department said housing starts fell in February to 2191 a four pct drop from last year when growth in Quebec housing starts was among the highest in the Canada the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp said The February rate seasonally adjusted now stands at 40000 down from 79000 in January the government agency said housing starts rose 26 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1851000 units the Commerce Department said In January housing starts fell a revised 05 pct to 1804000 units The department previously said they fell 01 pct The rate at which permits were issued for future construction rose in February by 44 pct to a seasonally adjusted 1764000 units after falling 1152 pct to 1690000 units in January Permits for single-family houses fell in January by 66 pct to 1091000 The number of permits for multi-family houses fell in February by 117 pct to 529000 units after falling in January by 193 pct the department said Housing starts in February included a seasonally adjusted 56 pct rise in single family units to 1317000 units and a 41 pct fall in multi-family homes to 534000 units The seasonally adjusted permits total in February for single family units was 1235000 and for multi-family units was 529000 units Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted 1987 will be the fifth successive year for growth in housing starts after a 26 pct rise overall in February starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1851 mln units This year should be the fifth solid year in a row for homebuilding activity -- with single-family units stronger than multi-family units he said in a statement Single-family starts rose last month from January levels by 56 pct to 1317 mln units on a seasonally adjusted basis while multi-family unit starts fell 41 pct to 534000 units the department said Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted 1987 will be the fifth successive year for growth in housing starts after a 26 pct rise overall in February starts to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1851 mln units This year should be the fifth solid year in a row for homebuilding activity -- with

multi-family unit starts fell 41 pct to 534000 units the department reported strong US housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth economists said Building was boosted by two factors last month unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy if any will come from housing in coming months And after a steady retreat mortgage rates seem to be near bottom US housing starts rose 26 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1851 mln units from 1804 mln in January It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986 The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 44 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1764 mln units after dropping 1152 pct to 1690 mln in January February's weather is usually more adverse for home building Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks As a result milder temperatures inflate the statistics Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'Let's do it now' said Mark Obrinsky of the US League of Savings Institutions in Washington whose members supply much of the financing for home building But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the US economy He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 950 pct fixed rate effective in February Last November fixed rate mortgages were about 1030 pct As expected the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1 Single-family starts rose at a 56 pct annual pace to 1317 mln units Multi-family fell 41 pct to a 534000 rate Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job But we're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets McCarthy noted that the housing report together with larger than expected gains in US employment industrial output and retail sales in February may cause some observers to start waving four pct GNP banners for the first quarter Gross national product grew 13 pct in the fourth quarter But McCarthy who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 25 pct or slightly above is not convinced that growth will pick up in future The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on now not all of which is intentional he said For example US automakers who are already saddled with high stocks produced at an annual rate of 83 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 73 mln Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second he said If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter we could foresee production slowing in the second cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy Crisanti and Maffei Inc who expects first quarter growth of about three pct National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes rose six pct during February from January levels to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 369 mln units The realtors' group said the sales rise was apparent across the country and reflected lower mortgage interest rates as well as more housing demand Actual resales of homes during February totaled 241000 up 116 pct from the January total of 216000 the association said Japan's housing starts in February rose 134 pct from a year earlier to 109254 the 10th successive year-on-year gain the Construction Ministry said February housing starts were up 168 pct from 93554 in January when they fell 274 pct from a month earlier but rose 103 pct from a year earlier Higher housing starts were mainly due to a 268 pct year-on-year rise in apartment building starts to 51829 for the 56th consecutive gain spurred primarily by lower domestic interest rates RUTER Senate passed a two year extension of federal housing programs including 15 billion dlrs for lower income housing assistance over two years The vote was 71 to 27 Total value of the bill was estimated at 31 billion dlrs The bill permanently extended the authorization for Federal Housing Authority mortgage insurnce The bill also extended the urban development grant program the national flood insurance act the rural housing program as well as several other housing programs The bill now goes to the House housing starts fell 27 pct in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1620000 units the Commerce Department said In April housing starts fell a revised 38 pct to 1665000 units The department previously said they fell 29 pct The rate at which permits were issued for future construction fell in May by 76 pct to a seasonally adjusted 1477000 units after falling 70 pct to 1598000 units in April The department said May housing starts were at the lowest annual rate since December 1984 when starts were at a seasonally adjusted 1612000 units The permits total was the lowest for any month since March 1983 when 1475000 permits were issued Before seasonal adjustment May housing starts fell to 159600 units from 161600 units in April Permits before adjustment fell to 134800 units in May from 157000 in April The department said single-family housing starts fell in May by 76 pct to 1129000 units from 1222000 units in April The May decline followed a slight 09 pct rise in single-family starts in April Starts for multi-family units rose 108 pct in May to 491000 units after declining in April by 146 pct to 443000 units Permits for single-family homes in May were down 50 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1005000 units from 1058000 units in April The decline followed a 80 pct drop in single-family permits in April Permits for multi-family units fell in May by 126 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 472000 units from 540000 units in April The May decline came after a 51 pct drop in the seasonally adjusted annual rate of permits for multi-family units in April trade-led boom in the US is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy Bank of America said in its latest economic report Although net exports will add 07 pct to GNP this year after reducing it by 12 pct in 1986 consumer spending will contribute 14 pct less to GNP than it did last year As a result GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 25 pct the same rate as last year according to Daniel Van Dyke the Bank of America economist who wrote the report Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income Van Dyke said Growth in US consumer spending is likely to slow to 18 pct this year from 41 pct in 1986 he predicted The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 02 pct in May after increasing 04 pct in April and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 01 pct compared with a 06 pct increase the month before The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 37 pct this year up from 19 pct in 1986 Bank of America forecast This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 13 pct in 1987 from 29 pct in 1986 As a result Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1210 dlrs during 1986 The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 42 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 163 mln units For the first time in several years a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility Van Dyke said Currently US growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade However with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country this source of growth is at risk he added
