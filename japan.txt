Japan has pledged to try to increase its purchase of US car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases the Commerce Department said US negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of US-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases a Commerce department official said He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that "statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers" It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985 US firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market unadjusted consumer price index (base 1985) fell 04 pct to 997 in January from the previous month the government's Management and Coodination Agency said The fall compares with a decline of 02 pct in December The January index compared with a year earlier was down 11 pct the first drop larger than 10 pct since it fell 13 pct in September 1958 Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing footwear and utilities causing the overall decline for the month Housing medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities gasoline and vegetables fell The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 01 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 1002 reflecting lower prices for food clothing and footwear Compared with a year earlier the index was down 07 pct due to lower vegetable fuel oil and utility costs Finance Ministry has proposed informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from February at five pct underwriting sources said They said the ministry wants a 050 yen raise in issue price from February to 9950 to yield a record low 5075 pct The 5151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record low The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the 600 billion in February The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed terms immediately the sources said interest rates on yen certificates of deposit CD fell to 427 pct in the week ended February 25 from 432 pct the previous week the Bank of Japan said New rates (previous in brackets) were - Average CD

(unquoted) life insurers trust banks and corporations largely responsible for vitalising the US Bond market in recent years are now eyeing stockmarkets in the US Britain France and Hong Kong fund managers said After concentrating on US Treasury bonds for years Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments they said Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986 Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd said Matsumoto who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 15 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs he added This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the US Markets Matsumoto said "The trend has been to head toward the US Market first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years" said Eugene Atkinson managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk he added However few see holdings in US Treasuries dwindling They will remain a Japanese mainstay fund managers said Institutions particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders are unlikely to sell their US Treasuries but will put in less money said Shinichi Kobuse manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities There has been some selling of US Bonds by short-term investors but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the US Bond market remains attractive he added Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the US Equity markets despite predictions by economists the US Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major US Corporations he added Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities hold a lopsided proportion of US Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the US But will now invest in Britain West Germany France and other countries Hashimoto said Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks he added One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in US 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies The bank is looking more at US Equities and European bonds he said Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase said Andrew Sheaf general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan "Last week was the busiest week we had" he said Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms fund managers said Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc they said Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability they added Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany particularly as German firms like their Japanese counterparts are concerned about the recent dollar fall Australia also poses some risks due to currency values they added is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 55 pct from 62 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris Finance Ministry sources said They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law which should be approved by parliament on March 3 abolishing the 605 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses they said The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates the sources said However it was impossible for them to follow the last cut to 58 pct from 62 pct on January 28 because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 605 pct The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy they said On Tuesday the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 55 pct effective February 28 The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare the sources said These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate the ministry sources said Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds minus 01 percentage points is the likeliest choice they added ruling and opposition parties agreed to reopen talks on the budget for the fiscal year ending March 31 1988 when the Lower House Budget Committee meets next Tuesday a parliamentary official said He said officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties agreed at a meeting of the committee's board of directors Strong opposition objection to government tax reform proposals including a controversial sales tax has delayed deliberation by the Lower House Budget Committee Tokyo Grain Exchange said it will raise the margin requirement on the spot and nearby month for US And Chinese soybeans and red beans effective March 2 Spot April US Soybean contracts will increase to 90000 yen per 15 tonne lot from 70000 now Other months will stay unchanged at 70000 except the new distant February requirement which will be set at 70000 from March 2 Chinese spot March will be set at 110000 yen per 15 tonne lot from 90000 The exchange said it raised spot March requirement to 130000 yen on contracts outstanding at March 13 Chinese nearby April rises to 90000 yen from 70000 Other months will remain unchanged at 70000 yen except new distant August which will be set at 70000 from March 2 The new margin for red bean spot March rises to 150000 yen per 24 tonne lot from 120000 and to 190000 for outstanding contracts as of March 13 The nearby April requirement for red beans will rise to 100000

towards China"s plans to improve its road network the official New China News Agency reported A 130 mln dlr World Bank loan will be used to build 12 new berths incorporating container handling systems at the northeast China port of Tianjin the agency said It gave no details of the repayment terms of the loans Steel Co Ltd <TOSST> and <Azuma Steel Co Ltd> affiliates of Nippon Kokan KK <NKKTT> are considering a merger company spokesmen said Toshin Steel owned 419 pct by Nippon Kokan and Azuma Steel owned 413 pct by Nippon Kokan are expected to decide by the end of March they said Both firms have been struggling with losses caused by the recession in the steel industry and the yen's appreciation Azuma Steel's current losses are estimated at 31 billion yen in the year ending March 31 against a 699 billion loss a year earlier a spokesman said The firm employs 1100 workers Toshin Steel with 1700 workers has given no forecast for the year ending March 31 But industry sources said they expected the company to show current losses of about five billion yen or more in 1986/87 compared with a 298 billion loss in 1985/86 customs-cleared trade surplus in the first 20 days of February jumped to 358 billion dlrs from 194 billion a year earlier the Finance Ministry said The February interim surplus was sharply up from a 96504 mln dlr surplus in the same January period FOB exports rose 146 pct from a year earlier in the first 20 days of February to 1091 billion while CIF imports fell 32 pct to 733 billion The average dollar/yen rates were 15232 for exports and 15231 for imports against 19661 for exports and 19627 for imports a year earlier Light Metal Co Ltd <NLGTT> which has annual capacity of 63000 tonnes will continue primary aluminium production at a rate of 35000 tonnes owing to low domestic and world prices and low water supplies at its hydroelectric power plant a company official said Nippon which has no plans to restore output to the 48000 tonnes a year at which it was working until late 1986 will become Japan's only smelter <Ryoka Light Metal Industries Ltd> will stop smelting in April owing to high power costs and low prices and <Mitsui Aluminium Co Ltd> has said it stopped smelting in February Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31 1988 from a projected 348 billion this year the company said Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5506 billion yen from a projected 5328 billion this year NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1770 billion yen in 1987/88 including 109 billion for research and development as against a total of 1600 billion this year An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January were the major factors behind the projected decrease in profits The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in 1985 external reserves rose to a record 5173 billion dlrs at the end of February from the previous record of 5146 billion at end-January the Finance Ministry said End-February reserves last year were 2758 billion dlrs In January the nation's foreign reserves showed the largest-ever monthly increase at 922 billion dlrs due to massive Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention during the month as the dollar fell briefly to an all-time low of 14998 yen on January 19 foreign exchange dealers said Inc> a distributor for Ford Motor Co <F> in Japan is considering importing cars made by <Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp> (MMUC) a wholly owned US Subsidiary of Mazda Motor Corp <MAZTT> an Autorama spokesman said Mazda owned 24 pct by Ford is due to begin production of the 2000-cc-engine cars at the Michigan plant in September at an annual rate of 240000 of which between 60 and 70 pct will go to Ford and the rest to Mazda's own US Sales network securities houses will issue new corporate bonds more quickly accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1 to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market securities managers said Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues they said "Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets" a Nikko Securities house bond manager said Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now the securities managers said Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end and accept issue requests during the month they said Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market securities managers said Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April with the projected issue by <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms securities sources said The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic they said The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market securities house managers said The finance ministry commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1 securities managers said The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now securities managers said The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process securities sources said It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds and for deregulation of private placements they said Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect the sources said A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law expected in 1988 the sources said importers bought some 95000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment under the semi-annual trade accords trade sources said The FOB premium rose to 1350 dlrs per tonne up 250 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment but down from 1380 for the last May to September shipment Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans including spot buying may have totalled 240000 to 250000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment down from some 300000 tonnes the previous year the sources said Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240000 to 250000 tonnes a year the sources said In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers but low 1986 US Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing they said banks are expected to give Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks banking sources said "We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling" said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt bankers said The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans "The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation" said another Japanese bank official He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions banking sources said They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 14 to 15 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987 Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here the sources added "Otherwise our response will be very negative" the senior official said Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems Barclays Bank plc <BCSL> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem the banking sources said BankAmerica Corp <BACN> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far East and representing them on the committee they added Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package political analysts said They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988 "Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican" Rei Shiratori professor of politics at Dokkyo University told "Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax probably in the summer" Shiratori said Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax "There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies" he told a meeting of government and party leaders "If the party discipline is broken I would like to see punishment considered" "A proposed sales tax has become a political issue partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it" Shiratori said "Moreover the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging" he said Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2500 local elections scheduled for April involving governors mayors town and village heads and assemblies at all levels But the situation is complicated since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP the political analysts added Shiratori said "In the worst case implementation of the sales tax now scheduled for next January may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision "Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct "A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs" he said Seizaburo Sato professor of politics at Tokyo University thought the last possibility most likely "I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills" he said The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign Sato said "Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed" he said combined profits of Japan's major corporations excluding financial institutions are forecast to fall 192 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31 compared to the 199 pct decline projected in late November Wako Research Institute of Economics said The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 116 pct fall in sales in the year against an 114 pct fall estimated last November Current profits are projected to fall 44 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 42 pct it said Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook the institute said It said lower interest rates which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs are also behind the improved performance outlook Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses it said The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88 Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs) a central bank official said The new guideline will go into effect on April 6 the bank said Under the guideline the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 05 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate the bank said But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same or 075 percentage point below the CD rates The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 037 point effective March 16 in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23 New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks for example will be 364 pct and 339 pct per annum respectively Demand deposit rates however will remain the same (Taiwan Power co) will boost its domestic borrowings to further cut its foreign debt in line with a government policy to trim the island's huge foreign exchange reserves a company official said The company's foreign debt mainly from the Japanese and US Banks was cut nearly by half to 662 billion taiwan dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 1246 billion in 1985 he said Its domestic borrowings however rose to 1052 billion taiwan dlrs from 806 billion in the same period he added Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now stood at 50 billion US Dlrs due to its 1986 record trade surplus of 156 billion Holdings Plc <RTRSL> said it would display an English language financial news service provided by the Japanese Jiji Press from the second quarter of 1987 The service which will be provided through the Monitor and Composite Information Service (CIS) will offer 24-hour reports on Japanese economic and political developments as well as specialised news on money markets and rates securities and technology Another Jiji service offering information on Japanese equity bond and money markets is also available on CIS AG <HFAGF> <Kerdix Inc> Boulder Colorado and <Nakamichi Corp> Tokyo have agreed to pool their research and development on magneto-optical memory discs Hoechst said in a statement Research will be carried out at each company and Hoechst will start to produce the discs by mid-1988 and distribute them worldwide under the brand name Ozadisc A Hoechst spokesman said an eventual joint venture was likely but could give no details consumers hesitated about buying the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today but said the DAT player's near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper "The sound is great but I'll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100000 yen before buying one" said Terumi Fujitsuka 35 a steel firm employee Aiwa Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks retailers said Aiwa's machine the cheapest is listed at 188000 yen Machines by Sony Hitachi Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March industry sources said DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties In negotiations that delayed the DAT player's debut the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier "Nobody can tell the difference" one salesman said DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added But Japanese hardware makers hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition are eager to carve out a profitable niche Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly possibly to around 70000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market industry analysts said They said by 1990 sales could reach six mln units per year Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year and the US Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other The talks held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of US/Japan economic relations will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure the US Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus US Officials said "We appreciate their frustration" a senior Japanese government official said "But we are also frustrated" The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade but it will he said He said the US Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress "It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments" a senior US Official replied The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance which last year amounted to 5148 billion dlrs in Japan's favour On the following two days the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing and the implications of government budget deficits These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more Some US Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports as Washington wants Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge US Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance That budget deficit has meant that the US Is buying more imports Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices "It condemns Japan without due process" one Japanese official said That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen he said Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the US Officials said Nevertheless Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them "We have no leverage" one official admitted As a result Tokyo is striving to meet US Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields including super computers The US Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers officials said appears resolved to encourage domestic demand for its goods instead of relying on exports to support its economy Jean-Claude Paye Director General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) told a news conference Paye has been in Japan exchanging views on problems confronting the world economy and the role of the OECD He met with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and other high-ranking Japanese officials is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said US Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks he said adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks" The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983 however Noting the often different reactions of US Japanese and European banks Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis "Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors" central bank president Francisco Gros said Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth some 15 billion dlrs Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain France West Germany Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes UK Banks around 85 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans giving the UK The third largest exposure after the US And Japan The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus its chief means of servicing its foreign debt started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'sate of inflation Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt "What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service because we cannot service all that" he said "I really think we have to change the old rules" Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis Funaro said "We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks because the banks have some limits" "It is a political discussion from our point of view" he said Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials He would then talk to the commercial banks "If I've got some solution from the governments I can't take the burden only to the banks" He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982 "You must open these mechanisms" he said He said that while the US Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments they understood Brazil had no other choice as it had to protect its reserves Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed "because we can't stay as we were the last few years" "I'm trying to put the problem on the table All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium" he said Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987 Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year against a monthly one billion in the first nine months Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world Funaro said although its share of international trade was only one pct "The solution is linked with growth not recession" he said noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments as opposed to commercial banks now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 412 billion dlrs of official debt Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves a Treasury spokesman said The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis Funaro accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium "because the banks have some limits It's a political discussion from our point of view" Funaro said on Friday that his talks with US Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis describing the meeting as an initial contact He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and US Treasury Secretary James Baker The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request After travelling this week to France Germany Switzerland and Italy Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31 1988 from a projected 348 billion this year the company said Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5506 billion yen from a projected 5328 billion this year NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1770 billion yen in 1987/88 including 109 billion for research and development as against a total of 1600 billion this year Air Lines Inc said it began service from Atlanta to Tokyo today The carrier will fly single-plane through service departing daily from Atlanta and Tokyo five days a week it said Electric Corp said it agreed in principle to form a joint venture in factory automation with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd of Japan The company said the venture aims to combine Matsushita's experience in high-volume electronics manufacturing and Westinghouse's knowledge of computer integrated manufacturing The venture will design sell and service automated manufacturing systems and is expected to begin operations by the summer it added is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said US Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks he said adding "This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks" The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983 however Noting the often different reactions of US Japanese and European banks Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis "Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors" central bank president Francisco Gros said Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth some 15 billion dlrs Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain France West Germany Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes UK Banks around 85 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans giving the UK The third largest exposure after the US And Japan The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus its chief means of servicing its foreign debt started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'rate of inflation Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 30 pct in January the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953 up from the previous record 29 pct in December the government's Management and Coordination Agency said Unemployment was up from 28 pct a year earlier Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 182 mln people up from 161 mln in December and 165 mln a year earlier Male unemployment in January remained at 29 pct equal to the second-worst level set last December Record male unemployement of 31 pct was set in July 1986 Female unemployment in January remained at 30 pct equal to the record level marked in April August September and December last year January's record 30 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries particularly in export-related firms due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar officials said Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380000 from a year earlier to 1430 mln including 183 mln employed in the textile industry down 190000 from a year earlier and 106 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders down 170000 yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the US Dollar for about a year the Bank of Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150 at least for the rest of the year" he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia Narusawa said the US Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the US Economy before the 1988 presidential election The yen is trading at around 15370 to the dollar investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices and on calculations gilt prices will firm bond managers said Japanese British and US Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains including city and trust banks which have been active on the US Treasury market they said Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said On the other hand major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year traders said These investors who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo a bond manager for a British securities house said The sterling/yen rate was about 24034/44 today up from 23450 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply However gilts may benefit from further declines in UK Interest rates they said "The UK Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here" said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 95 pct against 9581 pct at yesterday's close in London unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 35 pct within the next year from January's three pct record senior economists including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan said December's 29 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953 "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment" said Takashi Kiuchi senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd The government which published the January unemployment figures today did not make any predictions "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving" a Labour Ministry official said Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries Other export-dependent industries such as cars and textiles have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring economists said Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down said Koichi Tsukihara Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department However other economists disagreed saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare economists warned "The three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used" one economist said More than half of January's 170000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24 Sumitomo's Tsukihara said US Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years visiting US Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) a spokesman for Keidanren said The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress Wallis who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any US Trade bill is a moderate one rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country He was also quoted as saying the US Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three the spokesman said Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products A ban on rice imports triggered recent US Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the US To preserve a US-Japan pact on semiconductor trade but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak US Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement The MITI spokesman said "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure" MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987 spokesmen for the firms said But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money" a Hitachi Ltd <HITT> spokesman said major commercial banks plan to set up a joint company to which they will transfer assets acquired by lending to developing countries to build up a reserve against possible bad loans a senior official of a major bank told He said about 10 banks are likely to finish details of the project in a few weeks The intent is to avoid risk arising from unrecoverable debt owed by Third World countries he said Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available the proposal said It should provide currency and interest rate futures and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments To make this possible the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year US Treasury bonds Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles the sources said Japan's only current financial futures market in yen bonds began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985 But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April looks likely to allow US Banks to conduct securities business here a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down financial analysts said But the timing of the approval remains uncertain due to conflicting domestic interests JPMorgan and Co <JPM> Bankers Trust New York Corp <BT> Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp <CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan US Bank officials said "There is no reason for extended delay of approval" one official at a US Bank said The four US Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months To date Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market But if US Banks win approval Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the US Many US Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment US Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June At the last round of financial negotiations in September US Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the US Request since the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers including two Japanese brokerages last December They said the ministry will have to approve the US Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the US Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984 but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to US Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said No further details on the loan were immediately available Ayala told an oil seminar the project due for completion in 1988 is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market mainly along the Pacific coast The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz Ayala said Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project he said The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product he added European <Airbus Industrie> consortium has signed a one billion dlr contract to sell 10 A320 short-haul jets to <All Nippon Airways> of Japan with an option on the sale of a further 10 planes an Airbus spokesman said today The 10 planes on firm order will be delivered between September 1990 and November 1991 and will be powered either by CFM-56-5S engines made by the Franco-US <CFM International> consortium or V2500S engines built by the <International Aero Engine> group The spokesman declined to comment on a New York Times report that Airbus is about to announce a sale to American Airlines But industry sources said American was about to announce the purchase of 25 wide-bodied planes from Airbus as well as 15 747s from Boeing Co <BAN> Airbus has already signed large deals with Pan Am Corp <PNN> NWA Inc <NWA> and Eastern Airlines Inc <EALN> as well as a smaller contract with <Continental Airlines> The A320 made its first flight on February 22 and is not due to

oil prices rallied today moving over 1700 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices analysts said "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting" said Sanford Margoshes oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating" he added Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december The analysts said that to get others to hold the line Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil analysts said "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts and to prevent that it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales" Margoshes said He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar which has had trouble selling oil But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts Analysts said that Saudi Arabia with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart Daniel McKinley oil analyst with Smith Barney Upham Harris and Co said "both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally" He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo which refused discounts to Japanese buyers brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai which sent prices up on Mideast sours with Dubai trading up to 1650 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 1563 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments North sea brent today rose over 1700 dlrs with trades reported as high as 1705 dlrs up one dlr OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 158 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level "The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result" Margoshes said Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors including demand which could cut the rally short Marion Stewart an indepedent petroleum economist said slow growth in the economies of the US and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 14 pct over 1986 of American wine rose 149 per cent last year to a total of 72 million gallons the Wine Institute said The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent of the exported wine was from California and the top three markets were Canada Japan and Britain Japan which edged out Britain as the leading importer of American wines in 1985 continued in second place Canadian imports rose 32 per cent to 26 million gallons; Japan 99 per cent to 12 million gallons and Britain 202 per cent to 962360 gallons A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the California wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments The 1986 wine exports were valued at 347 mln dlrs up from 276 mln dlrs the previous year traders have apparently sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next six months due to high prices the US Agriculture Department said In its World Production and Trade Report the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices If the reports are confirmed China's major export destinations such as USSR Japan and South Korea could increase purchases of US corn it said China is currently forecast to export 55 mln tonnes of corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) it said Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he felt a proposed takeover by Japan's <Fujitsu Ltd> of US-based Fairchild Semiconductor Corp a subsidiary of Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> should be carefully reviewed He told the Semiconductor Industry Association the deal would soon be discussed by representatives of several different government departments The Reagan administration has previously expressed concern that the proposed takeover would make Fujitsu a powerful part of the US market for so-called supercomputers at a time when Japan has not bought any American-made supercomputers In addition US defense officials have said they were worried semiconductor technology could be transferred out of the United States eventually giving Japanese-made products an edge in American high-technology markets for defense and other goods Treasury Secretary James Baker recently told a Senate committee the proposed takeover would be reviewed by the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council Corp said Nippon Steel Co of Japan in a move to diversify into high technology invested eight mln dlrs in GTX Nippon's move was the result of current exchange rates and the revaluation of the yen which "have made the US electronics industry an attractive investment opportunity for Japanese corporations" according to a GTX statement GTX noted that Nippon is expecting sales of 27 billion dlrs by 1995 Of that amount six billion dlrs is targeted for electronics GTX located in Phoenix makes computerized systems that read drawings and transfer them into data bases Hokkaido Bank Ltd is issuing a 30 mln dlr convertible eurobond due March 31 2002 with an indicated 2-1/4 pct coupon and priced at par lead manager Nomura International Ltd said Terms will be fixed on March 10 involving a premium of about five pct above a six-day average The conversion period will run from April 20 1987 to March 20 2002 The bonds will be sold in denominations of 5000 dlrs and will be listed in Luxembourg Total fees of 2-1/2 pct include one pct for management and underwriting and 1-1/2 pct for selling including an 20 basis point praecipuum Nomura said the bonds are callable from March 31 1990 at 104 declining by 1/2 pct per annum There will be no calls before March 31 1992 unless the share price reaches at least 150 pct of the conversion price Chemical Co Ltd said it had developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to 10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now he said of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing US trade deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement Speaking to the President's Export Council an industry advisory group Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under discussion with those countries "I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us" he said In a wide-ranging discussion on US trade matters Baldrige also repeated US concern about an attempted takeover by Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing US companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to acquire control of a US company that does major computer business in the US market Lastly Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by the autumn but said major issues including acid rain remained unresolved Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for US banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments Previously the Fed Jan 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and US banking regulators Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity They ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of US banks to compete in world financial markets However the staff concluded "The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations" The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the UK-US effort to draft new capital rules of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization ICO coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States particularly the State Department to reassess its position but the US is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by "objective criteria" US officials said Jon Rosenbaum assistant US trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks told on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas At the ICO talks major consuming nations led by the US proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil by far the world's largest producer Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the US customs service to monitor coffee imports as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks but "nobody is proposing we change our position" However other US government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries led by Brazil and Colombia to soften the consumer position "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers" said one US official The US official who asked not to be identified said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries faced with mounting debt problems to the US State department and to the National Security Council in the White House for an easing of the US position US officials said The State department a major player in setting US coffee policy may then face conflicting pressures particularly from politically-sensitive US allies in Central America US officials said El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group which said it would agree to objective criteria There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question US officials said Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions In London the US was supported by the UK the Netherlands West Germany Japan Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria US officials said This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals However US sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult although not impossible for the US to block producer plans While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important US officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position US officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement Department of Transportation said that an administrative law judge had recommended that small package service between the United States and Tokyo be granted to Federal Express Corp <FDX> A final decision by the department is expected within 90 days In addition the department said the law judge recommended that backup service be granted to <Orion Air Inc> The order if finally approved would be for five years in the case of Federal and one year in the case of Orion Korea's record 71 billion dlrs trade surplus with the US is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of US companies Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 US cities Last year South Korea ran a 43 billion dlr trade surplus including a record 71 billion surplus with the US and a 55 billion dlr deficit with Japan Rha told in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 20 billion dlrs in purchases from US companies about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources" Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals machinery and parts" He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of US agricultural products The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the US He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be" considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the US- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors David Woods spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15 The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the US Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips officially known as semiconductors The EC Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave US Producers preferential access to the Japanese market Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong Canada Switzerland Singapore Sweden Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate Japan's delegate Minoru Endo and US Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the EC Charges were unfounded but they were willing to continue bilateral talks growth in corporate profits and in consumer spending the two pillars on which Japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth both look rotten at the core economists polled by said Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth But close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth they said Falling profits may lead to falling incomes which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily However this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports "No clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced" the central bank said Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow even though Japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen Economist David Pike of Phillips and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors The economists however believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while As more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad already fierce domestic competition will increase fueled by lower-priced imports Retail prices will fall Profit margins will suffer A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers) holding down wages and reducing bonuses The government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales But reduced bonuses and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging Twice a year bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza To save funds some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now On the contrary a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness education and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary The last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise Japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age Faced with such a vicious circle the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue Independent economists have been less than excited at the results Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited The 25 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further with the basic bank savings rate at only 025 pct Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit official figures show Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity Fear of inflation also limits policy options Political analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price inflation And he found this year that attempts to impose a sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition consortium of electrics industry firms to challenge Japan's presence in the global semiconductor market was announced by the Semiconductor Industry Association The initiative will be funded by US manufacturers to develop the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technologies the association said at a news conference Government participation and financial support will also be sought for the consortium called SEMATECH for "semiconductor manufacturing technology" "We can continue to sit back and watch the Japanese target and assualt yet another critical US industry Or we can get in gear and do what is necessary to repell this attack" said Irwin Federman chief executive officer of Monolithic Memories Inc He said the objective of SEMATECH a non profit corporation was to maintain leadership in an industry that was vital to the US economy and national security The plan was for SEMATECH to establish a facility at various manufacturers and equipment suppliers to pioneer advanced manufacturing techniques for semiconductors Express Corp said it received a recommendation from an administrative law judge that it be awarded the exclusive air express route between the US and Japan Federal Express said the recommendation now must be approved by the Secretary of Transporation Elizabeth Dole and President Reagan Federal Express said it received late last year preliminary approval by a panel over a consortium of United Parcel Service and DHL and other air express competitors from beef producing states and representatives of the US livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues Rep Hal Daub (R-Nebr) said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea Daub was joined by several other lawmakers US assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley replied "we're not going to let Japan off the hook or Korea" She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues Japan maintains a quota on beef imports set at 58400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987 South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to US pressure and allow some imports soon industry officials said In testimony today Tom Cook director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said "the Congress administration and the industry must take a strong tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets" plan by US semiconductor firms to cooperate in a manufacturing facility to compete with firms in Japan could conflict with anti-monopoly law the plan's backers said The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a news conference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH to build an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant Asked whether US antitrust regulators might object Charles Sporck president of National Semiconductor Corp said "That is a possibility" Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest in the project but he declined to estimate how much would be sought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH would require Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational plan ready by June 1 Then it will search for a site for the manufacturing facility and an executive to head up the consortium The consortium could be operating by the end of the year and the facility working in 18 months he said International Business Machines Corp hopes to participate in the effort Paul Low an IBM executive said He said the project suppliers of raw materials and others vital to the semiconductor industry such as toolmakers would be invited to participate Sporck said no decision was made on what product would be produced stressing that the emphasis was on developing technology and sharing that with firms which belonged to SEMATECH Other aspects were still undecided such as whether a Japanese firm with a facility in the United States would be allowed to participate he said Commerce Secretary Claude Pope said Japan's Okuma Machinery Works LTD will build a multi-million dollar manufacturing machinery plant here He said the plant will be the company's first in the US and will employ approximately 150 people He said start-up date is set for late this year state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts chairman Louis Lo said He told in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture to build two hulls for <Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd> was a success Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd <MITHT> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMAT> he said Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi which would complete production "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future" Lo said He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln US Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975 Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs But he said the company which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification" he said Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln US Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87 CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year compared with 11 ships of 462000 dwt in 1985/86 he said Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage but the outlook for ship repairing was bright group of creditor banks hopes to work out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd <JLITT> one of the world's largest tanker operators by the end of Japan's business year on March 31 a spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd <IBJTT> (IBJ) said Japan Line's cumulative debt was 6898 billion yen at the end of September which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 6340 billion In December Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares The spokesman for IBJ Japan Line's largest creditor said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long Commenting on the article he said the details of the package have not yet been settled wheat shipments rose to 133 mln tonnes in February from 101 mln in January an Australian Wheat Board official said February's shipments were down on the 154 mln tonnes shipped in February 1986 Cumulative shipments for the first five months of the October/September wheat year were 612 mln tonnes as against 654 mln a year earlier the official said The major destinations in February were: China (419196 tonnes) Egypt (301909) Iraq (142055) Japan (110261) South Korea (100847) and the Soviet Union (100056 tonnes) countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Subroto attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand "If we stick to the production limitation the third quarter will be in better balance" He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that" "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves I think they'll help each other" he said Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because  Everyone is sticking to official prices" he said easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency bond managers and traders said Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the Eurobond market few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the Japanese they said This lack of real yen demand through the freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 US And Japanese accord to internationalise the yen they said The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese interest rates but have no need for yen They arrange primarily with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies mainly dollars bond managers said More than 85 pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven they added "The borrowers don't care which currency they use They are only after attractive money" one bond trader said Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total Eurobond market Koichi Kimura managing director of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said recently Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues Many even resort to "harakiri" swaps those with unprofitable pricing But the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987 said Naoki Yokoyama manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation The Euroyen bonds once issued are mostly picked up by Japanese trust banks one trader said After a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is strong he added Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments traders said "Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen)" said Masaki Shimazu manager of Daiwa's bond department While few foreigners are interested in the secondary market Japanese commercial banks regional banks life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer little currency risk traders said The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from 180 A ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small "We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the Euroyen market" he said One trader said that although demand from Japanese investors is heavy it may prove to be only short-term He said many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or US Interest rates decline further To encourage further international use of the yen the ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen commercial paper the official said adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next few months But they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come Japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be "Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps" one bond manager said If more financial instruments were available there might be more trades in yen he added Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities traders said The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond maturities within a few months One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen But freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the Japanese currency he said "If exporters or importers can raise funds in yen they will be more willing to agree to using the Japanese yen as a settlement currency" he added The Finance Ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors "No major market can keep its status without change" he said has decided to redeem six years early a 20 billion yen 12-year 85 pct samurai bond due on August 18 1993 Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said as lead manager It will redeem 184 billion yen at 10300 and the rest at par this August 18 under an annual redemption obligation probably because of declining yen interest rates Daiwa said Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 500 billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a projected money market surplus money market traders said Of the total 300 billion yen will yield 39989 pct on the sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in 27-day repurchase agreement due April 2 The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 39994 pct in a 39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14 they said The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 40625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 450/43 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420 billion yen mainly due to payment of national annuities money traders said The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 1300 yen shr 1834 yen vs 5872 Net 1073 billion yen vs 3706 billion Pretax 2776 billion yen vs 8478 billion Operating 3006 billion yen vs 8881 billion Sales 88922 billion vs 95578 billion Note - The company attributed the profit fall largely to the yen's appreciation during the period Domestic sales rose 04 pct to 27417 billion yen from a year earlier while exports declined 99 pct to 61504 billion highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations told the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza" he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg" said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge" said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry "If you want my objective view I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again" he said exported 1816 tonnes of tin metal in January up from 1731 in December and 1330 a year ago the Mineral Resources Department said It said major buyers last month were Singapore Japan Britain the Netherlands Malaysia and the US state-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning April 1 trade sources said Japan the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of around 23 mln tonnes a year has asked India to reduce prices from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne the sources said "Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price" one source said but declined to give further details creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations international financial sources told Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month they said The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad the sources said Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project the sources said Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year they said There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks and perhaps as many as 28 they said About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands the sources said The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad the sources said The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina they said The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves but the ministry has not yet complied A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans Ministry of International Trade and Industry has not yet set a car export quota for <Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd> which is scheduled to start exports to the US Later this year a ministry official said Several local newspapers said the ministry had set a quota of about 10000 cars Daihatsu is owned 151 pct by Toyota Motor Corp <TOYOT> Quotas for nine car makers including Daihatsu are likely to be set before the end of March the official said and Co Ltd said it plans to issue 300 mln Eurodollar warrant bonds in two tranches with payment on March 30 through a syndicate led by Nomura International Ltd One tranche is of five-year 150 mln dlr bonds while the rest is of seven-year 150 mln dlr bonds but other issue terms have not yet been decided Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas much needs to be done" he told a press conference after three days of talks "What we need is a resolution of trade issues we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth" Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986 He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips supercomputers Kansai airport agricultural products and car telephones He warned that the US/Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy Despite the pact Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while US Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased he said of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) Noboru Gotoh called on the Government to issue additional construction bonds as an emergency measure to stimulate domestic demand Gotoh told a press conference that increased fiscal spending is the only alternative to prop up the economy as credit conditions are easy enough a JCCI spokesman said Japan faces serious unemployment unless more construction bonds to raise cash for public works are issued but Japan should continue to carry out fiscal reform programmes Gotoh said private plant and equipment investment will grow 01 pct in fiscal 1987 starting April 1 from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing sector spending the Japan Development Bank said Capital spending by manufacturing industries hit hard by the rise of the yen will fall 56 pct a survey said Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust it said The 01 pct overall increase compares to the 31 pct rise the bank projected for the current fiscal year In the manufacturing sector iron and steel companies are the most pessimistic with an estimated 180 pct spending cut Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will decline by 18 pct and 112 pct respectively the survey said In the non-manufacturing sector transport and leasing service industries are expected to increase their spending by 157 pct and 106 pct respectively The bank's survey conducted in early February was based on questionnaires from 1738 corporations in all sectors having a business relationship with the bank ruling Liberal Democratic Party started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable In the absence of the opposition LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14 parliamentary officials said The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone who has vowed to push through the tax reforms told reporters: "Watching closely negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties I would like to avoid  Passing (the budget) singlehandedly" The five pct tax part of Nakasone's tax reform plan is planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual income and corporate tax The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower House plenary session political analysts said The four opposition parties called the LDP move "an unforgivable rash act" and said they would fight to scrap the sales tax and Co Ltd said it plans to issue 300 mln Eurodollar warrant bonds in two tranches with payment on March 30 through a syndicate led by Nomura International Ltd One tranche is of five-year 150 mln dlr bonds while the rest is of seven-year 150 mln dlr bonds but other issue terms have not yet been decided Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 500 billion yen of financing bills it

27-day repurchase agreement due April 2 The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 39994 pct in a 39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14 they said The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 40625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 450/43 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420 billion yen mainly due to payment of national annuities money traders said The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 1300 yen Breweries Ltd of Japan is issuing 100 mln Swiss francs of five year notes with a 4-5/8 pct coupon and 100-1/4 issue price lead manager Swiss Bank Corp said The issue is guaranteed by Fuji Bank Payment is due March 17 Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he may recommend that the United States retaliate against Japan if the Japanese do not permit US construction firms to participate in building the eight billion dlr Kansai airport But he said he had a personal commitment from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that US firms would have a chance at the work "I think he will honor that commitment" Baldrige told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce affairs" He said one form of retaliation could be to curb Japanese firms' two billion dlr construction work in the United States said it signed a license agreement with British Telecommunications PLC <BTYL> to make and market a test instrument for digital microwave communications equipment Tekelec said the new product is expected to be priced at 25000 dlrs and to be shipped in the second half of 1987 The 20-year non-exclusive agreement grants Tekelec the right to manufacture and market the instrument in North America and Japan reduction of the US federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit US trade representative Clayton Yeutter said Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now "Unless we get the budget deficit down we will not get the trade deficit down" He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits Private analysts have said that the financing of large US budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of US Treasury and to a lesser extent other US securities as well "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987 but there's still a long way to go" Yeutter said He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on US and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth US competitiveness and the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade The US trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down On the fiscal side Yeutter said "the budget deficit is still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit In the international area he said that "our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth" Commenting on Japan which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States Yeutter said "Japan is just not doing the job on the import side" Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end" Yeutter said However he added that if the US and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the US trade deficit "the dollar will be the equalizer" Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem" Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by US trading partners Yeutter said "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation" Yeutter said adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations told the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza" he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg" said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge" said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry "If you want my objective view I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again" he said Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada principally into the country's bond market is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar He said the inflow of funds mainly from Japan Europe and the United States is the result of "confidence in the direction this country is going in" "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (US) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts" Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 231 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986 more than double the previous year with Japan investing a record 95 billion dlrs in the market Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad Canadian investment including the buying of foreign companies stocks and bonds rose to 1253 billion dlrs from 619 billion dlrs in 1985 The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada sales gained 2494900 tonnes in the week ended February 26 the highest weekly total since August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's level the US Agriculture Department said In comments on its Export Sales Report the department said sales of 10 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the US-USSR Grains Supply Agreement which began October 1 Japan added 689700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429800 tonnes Wheat sales of 362400 tonnes for the current season and 151000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from the previous week's combined sales it said Egypt Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for delivery in the current year while sales to China decreased by 30000 tonnes for the current season but increased by 90000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season which begins June 1 Net sales of soybeans totalling 274200 tonnes equaled the preceding week but were nearly a third below the four week average Major increases were for Belgium South Korea Mexico and Italy it said Soybean cake and meal sales of 103700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low but six pct less than the four week average Major increases for West Germany Belgium Spain Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations Soybean oil sales of 5400 tonnes were the result of increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for unknown destinations Combined sales activity in cotton of 75200 running bales -- 44700 bales for the current year and 30500 bales for the 1987/88 bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good showing the department said Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea Japan Taiwan and Thailand while South Korea and Indonesia were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season which begins August 1 Finance Minister Dilson Funaro will extend his international tour flying to Japan for talks with government officials and representatives of banks to explain Brazil's decision to halt payment of part of its 109-billion dlrs foreign debt Finance Ministry sources said Funaro who is in Rome today will fly to Tokyo on Sunday after having completed a week-long trip to the United States France England Italy West Germany and Switzerland Brazil halted payment of interest rates on 68 billion dlrs owed to 700 private commercial foreign banks as part of an strategy to alleviate the burden of its commitments Funaro who is accompanied by Central Bank governor Francisco Gros met only with government officials of the countries visited over the week In Tokyo however he is due to meet private bankers to whom Brazil owes some 68 billion dlrs the sources said He is due back in Brasilia next Wednesday March 11 the sources added Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) said its Far East customers would be charged 1725 dlrs per barrel for Isthmus crude in February and 1445 dlrs for the heavier Maya Pemex said this was 32 cts less than January Isthmus and 15 cts less than January Maya Far East customers primarily Japan which buys an average 180000 barrels per day of which 150000 is Isthmus pay retroactively while European and US clients are charged per delivery Secretary James Baker said there has been no change in US policy on the value of the dollar Baker when asked if the policy was changed in view of comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the dollar by 10 to 15 pct replied "No" Yesterday Robert Ortner Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs said he thought the yen was undervalued but said that was his personal view This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions Baker who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper Association declined to elaborate on his statement about US policy Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this year He told the National Newspaper Association "You're going to see a reduction in the Japanese trade surplus -- some of it this year" But he said the reduction would be due principally to the exchange rate shifts since the Plaza Agreement and these shifts would take a long time to work their way through the system government's move to pare its huge financing costs by shortening debt maturities has left more room for other borrowers and sparked a lively market for treasury bills senior market analysts said The Bank of Canada Ottawa's fiscal agent in the marketplace revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowing needs has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms and heavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction issued in terms of up to one year "The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs" the Bank of Canada said in its 1986 annual report released this week The government has said its budget deficit financing requirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31 1987 from 30 billion dlrs the prior year Projected fiscal 1988 requirements are 213 billion dlrs The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bond issues nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10 years Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market new issues with terms in the two- to five-year range Meanwhile treasury bills outstanding at year end totalled nearly 70 billion dlrs an increase of 103 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984 Although the amount of money saved from moving away from the long bonds was not disclosed bond experts believe it was considerable because of the much lower interest premiums paid on short term debt But market watchers were unsure what affect the move will have on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadian bonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preference for long term financings Bond traders said the Japanese who purchased a record 95 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year have adapted to the changes by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to the medium term issues offered by Ottawa "Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six months has been very much concentrated in the medium term maturities" noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be identified Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually develop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years Said David Gluskin vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc "When interest rates finally seem to have stopped going down there is going to be a flood of people trying to lock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in the door" But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates trending down investors appear to welcome the change especially the greater treasury bill financing "The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active" said Michael Berry vice-president of the securities firm Walwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd The change also improves receptivity in the market for other borrowers including provincial governments the big utilities and corporations "There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end now that also may be the result that any percieved shortage has probably been taken up by provincial funding activities" commented Berry director of the Treasury Department's office of international banking and portfolio investment said Japan should open its bond and stock markets to more US firms "The Treasury would like to see greater openness of Jaspanese markets including more US firms admitted to the Tokyo Stock Exchange and an increased role for US financial firms in the Japanese Government bond market" Ammerman said in a prepared speech for a conference on financial services sponsored by Georgetown University Ammerman also said the Reagan administration hopes "any discrimination against US banks wishing to set up in the securities business in Japan in their own name will be eliminated promptly" He said the United States also was pressing Canada to stop giving favored treatment to domestic banks over US competitors and was talking with Canadian representatives He said the United States will "press vigorously for liberalization" of financial services in all foreign markets If negotiations fail "We will not hesitate to take vigorous actions to promote or protect our interests" he added Liposome Co Inc said it and its wholly-owned subsidiary Liposome Japan Co Ltd will sponsor a major seminar on liposome at Tokyo University on March 12 1987 Liposomes are microscopic man-made spheres composed of lipids that can be engineered to entrap drugs or other biologically active molecules within the lipid membranes of the spheres or in the aqueous space between the membranes the company explained Leading academic research and government institutions in Japan are expected to attend the company said Reserve Board member Robert Heller said the trend toward global financial markets required that all participants be treated even-handedly on such matters as bank capital requirements The recent US-UK agreement on capital adequacy provided a model for others including Japan Heller told a Georgetown University conference on financial markets "If they (the Japanese bank) want to do more business in Europe or the United States they have got to adhere to international standards" he said Heller said there were talks currently between the United States and Japan on bank rules He said the trend toward internationalization in financial services would cause markets to move to centers with the least regulation "That is not desirable We want to have a sensible amount of regulation" Heller said Soviet Union has agreed to cut its coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an increase in export volume industry sources said The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky coal and at 4380 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal fob Japan will import a total of 49 mln tonnes from both areas up from 42 mln a year earlier they said The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to 37 mln tonnes in 1987/88 but the Soviet Union urged Japan to increase the amount to 65 mln they said Japanese credit rating agencies are entering into fierce competition with <Moody's Japan KK> and <Standard and Poor's Asia Inc> the local branches of the two US Giants as the Japanese credit market opens up to foreigners Japanese rating agency managers said Standard and Poor's recent triple-A rating of <Chiyoda Fire and Marine Insurance Co Ltd's> claims-paying ability caused the Japanese agencies which had rated Chiyoda's convertible bond only A-plus to come under some criticism for being too conservative they said Chiyoda is Japan's eighth largest non-life insurer Standard and Poor's Corp has been in the business for more than a century while <Moody's Investors Service Inc> was founded more than 80 years ago Each has rated some 20000 to 30000 US And about 100 Japanese issues With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through overseas financing companies Chiyoda's rating will stimulate their interest in using the US Agencies the analysts said Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on its strong capitalisation stable performance and high levels of unrealised appreciation particularly in its stock portfolio The US Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory environment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratings on the claims-paying ability of <Sumitomo Life Insurance Co> and <Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's the first ratings given to Japanese life insurers Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off shocks from any foreign investment Standard and Poor's said A month ago <Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assigned an AAA rating to <Financial Securities Assurance Inc> a US Firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities "NIS has assigned rates on a US Firm for the first time in Japan which was the first step into the US Rating market" Kazuya Kumura general manager of NIS said Kyosuke Yoshida managing director of Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI) said "Agencies should be more actively used to respond better to growing overseas investor interest" Takeshi Watanabe president of Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd (JCRA) said "(Our) advantages are that we have a deeper understanding of business practices in Japan other Asian nations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert and quick to react to domestic news" JBRI with 12 years' experience is Japan's largest agency The other two have been in business for two years Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by Japanese residents which is expected soon will stimulate local agencies to grow quickly securities analysts said The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by gradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation In December it allowed non-residents holding at least an A-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai shogun and euroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent financial criteria But local companies regardless of the rating obtained for a planned bond must meet the tough financial criteria set by commissioned banks and underwriters which includes minimum net asset requirements and capitalisation local agency managers said Commissioned banks are responsible for protecting bondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by the very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanese credit rating agencies the managers said "The idea of rating in Japan has been woven into prerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial criteria" JCRA's Watanabe said The Finance Ministry commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds "An internationally comprehensive market system is needed to lure more overseas investors into the Japanese market" JBRI's Yoshida said securities houses are thinking of allowing foreign brokerages to underwrite more Japanese government bonds from April securities managers said The average foreign brokerage now underwrites only around 007 pct of each such issue's volume they told The proposal is a response to overseas calls for Japan to liberalise its markets in the trend towards global trading Japanese brokerages are consistently heavy buyers of US Treasury issues <Nomura Securities International Inc> and <Daiwa Securities America Inc> were named primary dealers in US Government securities in December they noted Brokerages within the government bond-writing syndicate are now negotiating by how much foreign house subscriptions to government bonds should be raised the managers said The syndicate members agreed in April 1982 that 26 pct of 10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93 securities firms 17 of them foreign and 74 pct by banks The Finance Ministry later approved the arrangement Foreign brokers want to underwrite more government bonds due to their end-investor appeal <Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd> caught market attention by buying 45 billion yen of the 100 billion of government two-year notes auctioned on February 3 Salomon's operation was an attempt to demonstrate its commitment to the Japanese market in the hope of expanding its underwriting share of 10-year bonds securities sources said They said that to expand participation by foreigners the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share cut local brokerages' share or introduce auctions to the government bond primary market the sources said Bankers are likely to oppose losing any share and the Finance Ministry is unwilling to introduce auctions on the ground that it would slow smooth absorption of bonds in the secondary market securities manager said United States has openly attacked Japan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time and warned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be significant senior US Officials said In high-level talks last week the US Criticised Japan's overall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its fiscal position is not as dire as it says The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some US Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating attempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports The US Attack represents a distinct shift by the conservative Reagan administration which until recently has been sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government role in the economy diplomats said Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take action to boost demand a senior US Treasury official said the April package must be more than routine Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do not expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of last April's measures That means accelerated public investment lower interest rates on government housing loans and measures to pass along the benefits of the strong yen to consumers none of which would have a major immediate economic impact Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to stimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the Finance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in US Policy But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by fanning resentment against US Interference in domestic affairs Makoto Kuroda vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan would stimulate the economy not in response to US Criticism but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen The shift in US Policy is also causing some nervousness within the Reagan administration US Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told reporters last week the US Does not necessarily want an increase in Japan's budget deficit "There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its economy" he said The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development What is new is US Backing for the position At last week's talks Japanese officials said they argued Tokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boost the economy with funds from the giant postal savings system But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for and receive the figures supporting the new US Position a senior US Official said Other western officials are not so sure They said it would take time to boost public investment much further as there are not that many projects in the pipeline Stepped-up capital spending would help domestic construction companies but it would not have much impact on imports they added customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price and Western traders have received even larger discounts Japanese traders involved in the transactions told NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas One company has bought 800000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price the sources said Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount they said Iran's discounted sales have not however managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets oil traders said Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe and reports that OPEC's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 158 mln barrels per day Firmer gas oil on the London futures and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels they said Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount the sources said "It's just disguised cheating" one Japanese trader said The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil It has purchased 15 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices or with part of the price related to processing arrangements 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 25 pct this year compared with a 28 pct growth forecast in December It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences and Japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 22 pct from 32 pct in December and to 23 pct from three pct for Japan It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988 due in large part to a 150 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices It said the US Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986 It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 1650 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 1550 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 184 pct drop The average mark/dollar rate is put at 180 marks this year and 170 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing" the EIU said "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan or a tighter US Fsical policy" it said It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy US Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss "Thus far they have been willing" the EIC said adding that if Japan was deterred from buying US bonds the dollar would collapse To contain such a currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis it said On trade the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly sick" Import growth forecast in December at 45 pct is now seen slowing down to around 38 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 42 pct in 1988 it said The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 35 pct growth in 1987 against the 65 pct forecast in December the EIU said On the export side it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by US Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower more competitively-priced dollar It said in most of Europe and in Japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 port operator <Hong Kong International Terminals Ltd> a 89 pct held unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHHHK> said it has placed a 164 mln HK Dlr order for

cranes Bank of Japan president Takashi Tanaka told Brazil the bank will continue to cooperate with it but he refrained from making any commitment to a new credit Ex-Im officials said In a 30-minute meeting Tanaka told Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro the bank would consider his country's request for a 300 mln dlr credit in the context of international cooperation the officials said They said this meant the Ex-Im Bank would grant the credit as part of a package with money from the International Monetary Fund and private banks Brazil has resisted going to the IMF for help because it fears that the Fund will ask for changes in its economic policies that will throw it into recession Brazil first requested the 300 mln dlr credit last November to help it develop the sale and

technology and its commercialization in Japan Korean Foreign Trade Minister Rah Woon Bae said his country's firms have agreed to buy 18 billion dlrs worth of US goods during his two-week buying trip to the United States Rah said most of the purchases represented shifts from Japanese firms to US firms as part of South Korea's effort to reduce its seven billion dlr trade surplus with the United States South Korea has a five billion dlr trade deficit with Japan crushers bought 5000 to 7000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business over the weekend for April shipment trade sources said Japanese crushers continue to concentrate on rapeseed purchases since it converts to a higher percentage of oil than other oilseeds they said A glut of feed meals makes other oilseeds such as soybeans less desirable because they would add to already large meal stocks authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the US bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28 This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the US Treasury The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan's State of the Union message and was "in a manner consistent with the joint statement" made by US Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations At that meeting the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred But on January 28 the dollar closed at 15150/60 yen after dipping as low as 15040 yen earlier in the session It had closed at 15105/15 yen the previous day The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 14998 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 17675 marks on January 28 It ended that day at 17820/30 marks The Fed noted that after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar During the final days of January pressure on the dollar subsided Reports of the US-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters the Fed said Moreover doubts had developed about the course of US interest rates The dollar's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 18320 marks and 15370 yen According to the Fed's trade-weighted index it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period The dollar had risen as high as 208 marks and 165 yen in early November The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7 1985 when it bought a total of 1022 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord has contributed to the stability of exchange rates Miyazawa told a press conference the agreement reached last month in Paris by six major industrial nations to cooperate in bringing about currency stability has prevented speculative concerns from being active in money centres The decision in Paris is being understood by the market he said The yen-dollar exchange rate has been moving in a narrow range since finance ministers of Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany reached the accord arrested two Polish citizens for trying to steal Japanese computer technology local media reports said today The reports said the two had worked at a computer-related company in Tokyo and visited Japanese computer makers several times after coming to Japan on tourist visas last October One report said they were computer specialists at a Polish technology institute and that the company they worked for was managed by a naturalised Japanese from Poland who was a graduate of the institute Police officials declined to comment on the reports Finance Ministry auctioned 1000 billion yen worth of tankoku six month debt-financing paper to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19 a spokesman said The last tankoku auction on February 12 produced a record low yield of 3383 pct reflecting expectation of a half point cut in Japan's discount rate he said In the previous auction for 1000 billion yen four major Japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional investors securities managers said Securities managers said they expect the auction to go well again this time as securities houses will try to expand their inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from institutional investors Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku short-term interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for funds ahead of the March 31 financial year-end they said The Bank of Japan has been trying to dampen money market rates to make the latest discount rate cut effective but so far in vain dealers said The auction results will be announced tomorrow Ltd <ITSUT> may assemble computers in Oregon for sale in the United States under the Fujitsu brand name a company spokesman said He said the rising value of the yen against the dollar has virtually erased the wage differential between the two countries and Fujitsu would like to make the medium-size multi-functional business computers in the United States The Oregon plant owned by Fujitsu subsidiary <Fujitsu America Inc> now makes magnetic computer discs and will soon make printers Fujitsu Ltd also has a licensing agreement to make Amdahl Corp <AMH> computers for sale in the US microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a US-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips industry analysts said But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) which is pressuring the firms can successfully battle market forces and whether the US Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space they said US Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact the analysts said "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done" said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe Last month MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan market analysts said US Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts several analysts said Last week NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands" said David Keller analyst at James Capel and Co "Once NEC cuts production it means they all have" Still pressures remain to keep production high Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for US Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact "The best way to lower cost is to produce more" said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions some industry officials said "It's like tax avoidance schemes" said Steve Donovan head of MMI Japan KK "As soon as you close one route another opens" MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance "It's getting to be like communism" said one But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss "They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses" Bache's Wolffe said MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips but US Industry officials said response has been mixed at best "There has been some change but it's not across the board" said one US Spokesman "The companies have a varying degree of urgency" The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled US Industry remains in doubt analysts added Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips where Japan now leads analysts said Whether US Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips or interested in doing so also remains unclear they said Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new US Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing Even in the thorny area of access much depends on US Commitment as well as on Japanese openness some said "The SIA (US Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't even have an office here" a source close to the industry said "You could question just how committed they are" In addition some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea "(South) Korea's gaining market share" said one analyst "They're the real winners from the agreement" Finance Ministry said its auction yesterday of 1000 billion yen of tankoku six-month debt financing paper produced a record low average yield of 3246 pct on aggressive bidding from securities houses The tankoku mature on September 21 1987 The previous record low was 3383 pct at the last auction on February 12 One of four major Japanese securities house bought 395 pct of the total 10211 billion yen in bids accepted ministry sources said Securities houses bid aggressively as big retail accounts such as tokkin special money trust and trust funds have been showing strong interest in tankoku on increasing demand for short-term fund management securities house managers said The yield for tankoku issued on a discount basis is one point below the 426/12 pct interest rates for six-month certificates of deposit today In the previous auction for 1000 billion yen the four majors took 92 pct of the issue to increase their tankoku inventory the managers said Bids totalled 19758 billion yen The average price was 9836 to give a yield of 3246 pct and lowest was 9833 giving 3314 pct the Ministry said of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit "The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy" he told a press conference His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets Conflicting economic indicators from the US Have also been dampening market activity he added crushers are likely to buy at least 200000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and another 100000 to 200000 if quality and shipping conditions are good against 128089 tonnes in 1986 trade sources said A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31000 tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment they said "Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a bushel cheaper than US Origin due to the bumper harvest it is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their buying volume" one source said Brazilian beans are available to Japan for shipment from May to July Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd> has reached agreement with <Lombard North Central Plc> of the UK To build plants and boost the local content in Nissan's UK Produced cars to 60 pct in 1988 from 40 to 50 pct the Nissan Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> said The agreement will allow the cars to be designated as domestically manufactured rather than imported vehicles Nissan said The agreement was reached through

National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBLL> will build and lease plants for engine assembly body panel pressing and resin moulding by 1988 They will be near the existing Nissan plant in Sunderland in north-east England Nissan said The Sunderland plant currently produces 24000 Bluebird cars annually for the British market Nissan hopes to begin UK Exports to Europe in 1991 after building an engine machining plant which would boost output to 100000 units a year and local content to above 80 pct in accordance with EC requests the spokesman said crushers starting to buy US Soybeans for April shipment have recently made purchases of some 48000 tonnes trade sources said The sources said they could not estimate the total volume to be purchased for April shipping because Japan's crushing program for April and June is unclear They had predicted earlier that crushers' April shipment US Bean purchases would drop to 260000 to 270000 from the monthly average of 300000 to 330000 tonnes due to low soybean meal prices Agency of Natural Resources and Energy said it will begin experiments with Thailand at the end of March to start commercial production of rare metals in 1989 under a joint project An agency official said it will set up a 500 mln yen pilot plant in Bangkok which will extract high quality rare metals such as titanium and niobium from sand left over from tin production processes in Thailand The plant wilq use about a tonne of sand per day although it is unclear how much rare metal will be extracted the official said Oil Co Ltd <NPOLT> predicted parent company net profit of about nine billion yen in the year ending March 31 down 104 pct from a year earlier president Yasuoki Takeuchi told a press conference Current profit for the year was estimated at 17 to 18 billion yen down 20 to 24 pct from a year earlier he said Takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1700 billion yen for the fifth consecutive year-on-year drop This year's fall was due to lower selling prices for end-users which more than offset the yen's appreciation The company will retain six yen dividend for 1986/87 Steel Corp <NSTCT> and <Inland Steel Co> of the US Are negotiating to set up a joint steel venture in Indiana a Nippon Steel spokesman said declining to give more details Several local newspapers reported the joint venture would be capitalised at 150 mln dlrs owned

arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987 against an estimated 175 mln for the current year Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel

directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) automobile industry sources said Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to be at most unchanged from last year's 110 mln units and may even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic growth and increasing trade friction Last week MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to exercise prudence in exporting to Europe Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January to build up depleted vehicle inventories industry sources said Japan's vehicle exports to Europe in January rose 38 pct from a year earlier to 174133 units In December exports fell 704 pct year-on-year as makers curbed shipments to meet an earlier directive from MITI to limit 1986 exports they said Commercial banks are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan US Bank officials said A senior official at one of four prospective banks said the ministry told his bank it would give approval as long as the parent firm holds no more than 50 pct of the capital "We expect the ministry to give us

at a private meeting "Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October It depends on when (the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval" Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative stronghold The socialist winner backed by other opposition parties had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax the main plank of the reform plans The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1 which includes the tax plans They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of parliament since February 4 "If I were Nakasone I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans" the aide said Under law a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twiceThe other option would be to extend the current session he said "The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another" One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform "Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election" the aide said That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512-seat Lower House necessitating by-elections The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July There are five independents and three vacancies "The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats but at the expense of fierce media criticism" the aide said He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26 About 2600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections "Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax

expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax If the boycott is lifted tomorrow Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government's 1987/88 budget Japanese officials said Kuranari said both the US And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm unemotional manner But he added "If the issue of rice is to be raisedI would mention the feelings of the Japanese people" Japanese

firms are being squeezed out of work on Kansai and threatened to restrict Japanese construction firms in the United States if Kansai is not opened to US companies Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt He said in an interview with that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 445 billion dlr foreign debt Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 45 billion dlrs against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced he said "yes I think so" Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy US products valued at 18 billion dlrs About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen He said in the interview the US purchases were to reduce his country's 71 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 56 billion dlr shortfall with Japan Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the US dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy US goods than Japanese goods He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions" But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons" Speaking of his own country he said "We have made a lot of concessions already" He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs Asked if South Korea would retaliate against US goods if Congress closed US markets to its products he said "at this moment we have no thought of retaliation" South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods such as television sets video cassette records and personal computers Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs recent purchase of 15 mln tonnes of US corn by Japan and 600000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing the US Agriculture Department said In its World Production and Trade Report the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn With these corn purchases Japan is committed to buying 77 mln tonnes of US corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug) nearly 400000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 25 mln tonnes up 15 mln compared to last year it said today called on Japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy "I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan's domestic economy" he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London "But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary" he said "It is not just a domestic issue for Japan If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies particularly in the US With whom Japan has so massive a surplus" he said "They may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan and the UK" Channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between Japan and Britain amounting to 62 billion sterling (98 billion dlrs) last year But he added: "Regrettably too much of it was in one direction with the Japanese selling us 37 billion sterling (58 billion dlrs) more than we sold them" has relaxed its limit on the establishment of securities company outlets in order to service a growing number of individual investors the

department stores supermarkets and other locations convenient for individuals Foreign securities firms are not affected by the ruling it said efforts to redirect Japan's export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> (MHI) which began making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130 years ago is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets "If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products everyone will buy them" MHI president Yotaro Iida said Although two of MHI's main businesses shipbuilding and power plant construction have been hit hard by the yen's 40 pct rise against the dollar the company has no plans to abandon them Iida told in an interview Its other big activity aircraft component manufacture has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year "We have made the utmost efforts among the world's manufacturers to improve productivity" he said "You may be surprised if you come to see our plants The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern with robots and computers" Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors The company has slashed its workforce to 47000 from 86000 in 1976 Despite its cost-cutting MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31 from 1985/86's record 5014 billion And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMTT> for 49 billion yen Iida is optimistic about the future however He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 259 pct in the half-year ended last September from 35 to 36 pct five years ago China is the most promising market although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers "Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency" Iida said But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future In shipping MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport Shipbuilders Association officials told MHI is the world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity Domestically MHI is involved in 12 national projects including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles although all of these have been built under licence from US Firms MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a US Plane either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16 to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the US "It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with US Makers as Japan is supported by the US Defence umbrella" Iida said MHI also plans to cooperate with the US In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage he said The US Has been seeking Japan's technological support In fiscal 1985/86 aircraft accounted for 171 pct of MHI's sales shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 279 pct Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct As for the remaining 30 pct Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods but he declined to specify which products "By the end of this year you may find our brand name on your daily products although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business" he said corporate bankruptcies in February fell 108 pct from January to 1071 cases and total debts dropped 494 pct to 14940 billion yen the Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co said February bankruptcies fell 149 pct from a year earlier the 26th straight monthly decline and debts fell 543 pct The lower number of bankruptcies in February reflected a relaxation of money market conditions and reduced bill settlements due to fewer operating days it said Bankruptcies caused by the strength of the yen against the dollar totalled 69 or 64 pct of those in February with debts of 2552 billion yen the research firm said This compared with 64 with debts of 12559 billion yen in January it said Currency-linked bankruptcies since November 1985 when the dollar's depreciation against the yen began to affect Japanese export-linked firms totalled 772 with cumulative debts of 66053 billion yen it said The value of the yen against the dollar rose to an average 15349 yen per dollar in February from 18462 a year earlier Bankruptcies usually decline in the first quarter of the year due to fewer operating days and for seasonal reasons Bankruptcies are expected to increase in the quarter starting April 1 due to expectations of slow consumer spending low wage increases for the 1987/88 fiscal year which starts in April and slow capital spending by manufacturers the company said Bankrupcties among export-linked subcontractors will rise due to a recent shift by major manufacturers to overseas production it added Sekiyukagaku KK> and <Exxon Chemical Co> a petrochemical division of Exxon Corp <XON> said they agreed to accelerate a study to set up an equally-owned joint venture to make waterwhite resin in Japan Details of the venture to be based on Exxon Chemical technology will be set later the companies said Waterwhite resins are widely used in adhesive applications for baby nappies medical tapes and other bonding agents Tonen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toa Nenryo Kogyo KK <TNENT> which is owned 25 pct by Exxon Corp Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major US Computer and semiconductor maker US Officials said yesterday The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> unit <Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> The officials said the sale could leave the United States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used in advanced missiles aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering The US Officials added the sale would also worsen the strained relations between the two countries stemming from the huge Japanese trade surplus The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks they said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments or companies Computers made by US Manufacturers are widely used in the world but Tokyo told US Negotiators recently it prefers local manufacturers and would not buy US Supercomputers Tokyo Stock Exchange said in a statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen convertible bonds The cut would be in response to a planned increase in securities transaction tax to 26 yen per 10000 yen from 45 as part of the government's proposed tax reform bills securities house managers said Under the current system investors must also pay 06 pct of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen The exchange's draft revision sets brokerage fee percentage rates in inverse proportion to the size of amounts transacted market sources said Details of rates on transactions under 30 mln yen have yet to be worked out an exchange spokesman said The news had little immediate impact on the convertible bond market because participants are unsure when the new rates will be introduced and because the timing of parliamentary approval of the tax reform bills is uncertain due to opposition to them securities dealers said overseas production in yen terms of Japanese firms should rise 26 pct in 1987/88 ending March after a four pct fall in 1986/87 a Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey said It attributed the rise to companies moving production overseas to avoid losses due to the strong yen The survey covered 122 major firms in 17 sectors The survey called for bold moves to stimulate domestic demand to achieve the government's goal of 35 pct gross national product growth in 1987/88 A package of economic measures to boost the economy is expected next month The survey said Japanese car output in the United States and Canada would jump to two mln vehicles in fiscal 1990 from 617000 in 1986 and worldwide electronic appliance output would rise 317 pct Domestic unemployment is likely to reach four pct or about 25 mln jobless in fiscal 1990 from three pct now if current trends continue Recruitment in the car industry is expected to fall by 35 pct in 1987/88 and by 40 pct in the electronics sector The steel industry plans to cut its 150000 workforce by 27 pct by the end of 1990/91 and the shipbuilding coal and non-ferrous metal industries all plan big cuts in 1987/88 Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 200 billion yen of financing bills under a 50-day repurchase agreement maturing on May 2 to help absorb a projected money market surplus due largely to distribution of local allocation tax ahead of the March 31 fiscal year-end money traders said The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39496 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate for two-month commercial bills and the 446/37 pct yield today on two-month certificates of deposit The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 1500 billion yen coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia the world's third largest producer is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas "But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position we can never bridge the gap" Dharyono said Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries along with Costa Rica the Dominican Republic Ecuador Honduras India Papua New Guinea and Peru which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London Brazil which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme blocked the proposal AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise Edward Muda an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia the world's second largest producer but gave no details "Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise Without one they will suffer if the present market stays like it is" Muda said He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the US Japan the Netherlands West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1 Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the US And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed "realistic criteria" The breakaway group believes the old quota system which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines Brazil and the US The largest consumer are both refusing to alter their positions Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system Dharyono said Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87 ending September 30 is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360000 tonnes he said He said stocks at 90000 tonnes were about average for the time of year corporate earnings will rise 89 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate the Nomura research institute said Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 19 pct in the year which starts April 1 the research arm of Nomura Securities Co said in a statement Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct The forecast assumes an average rate of 1485 yen to the dollar in 1987/88 compared with 160 yen in the current year Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation such as cutting production costs are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year the institute said The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods it said Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected to rise 296 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 401 pct fall in the current year Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 45 pct in 1987/88 against an estimated 22 pct rise in the current year it said is ready to discuss bank regulation and capital adequacy with western monetary authorities but cannot say when or how joint rules can be agreed Japanese vice-minister of finance for international affairs Toyoo Gyohten said He told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets that Japan viewed a January outline agreement between the Bank of England and US Regulatory authorities as "significant" The accord setting joint rules on capital adequacy was criticised in financial markets for excluding Japan thus putting US And UK Banks at a disadvantage to Japanese banks "I am pleased to say that we are prepared to work with British and American regulators" Gyohten said He added that preliminary contacts had already been made in the margin of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basle where central bank governors of western nations meet every month But proper negotiations were still some way off "We have to start learning about the different situations in each country before we can start working towards joint rules" he said "I can't predict when or how we will reach conclusions" he added Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 200 billion yen of financing bills under a 50-day repurchase agreement maturing on May 2 to help absorb a projected money market surplus due largely to distribution of local allocation

securities firms are not affected by the ruling it said Japanese real estate company said it will launch a campaign to sell land in US Farming areas to rich Japanese Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2200 acres of land in Illinois California Florida and Indiana from early April to gauge response It set up International Farm Corp of America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation American farmers would continue as working tenants and part of the profits from harvests of rice corn soybean and oranges would go to the Japanese investors as rental Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told sales were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use "Two years ago I began to seek my own farmland in Japan" said Isao Nakamura president of Higashi Nippon "However sale of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government so I began to look for the land in the US to make my dream to own farm land come true" Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the US To sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face difficulties due to the recession in US Agriculture Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major US supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons US officials said The officials who asked not to be named said yesterday that Baldrige has "serious concerns" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp to Fujitsu Ltd another major electronics firm The officials told that if the sale went through it could leave the US military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering In addition they said the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the US and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks they said Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other US manufacturers are widely used throughout the world but none have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese government-run agencies and universities worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon Japanese bank economists polled by said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year helped by rising exports stepped-up government spending and falling prices "The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year" said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed "It (the bottom) is in the offing" he said But he added that the recovery will be slow Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 22 pct from two pct in the current year he said Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis after declining toward the end of last year Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery Industrial production fell 07 pct in January much smaller than expected and is forecast by the government to rise 03 pct in February and 26 pct in March A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end they said Six nations - the UK Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the US Market "The important thing is the exchange rate" Taketomi said If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment although there are no signs of that yet economists said A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the US economy may be starting to recover economists said Domestically the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter 1986 Most private economists expect a rise of about 05 pct from the previous quarter In the third quarter GNP rose 06 pct But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity To maintain year-on-year growth of around 25 pct the economy would have had to rise about 12 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986 the official said Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986 Because the coins were classified as legal tender their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses they said As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted economists said Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected while that of the external sector was better Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels industry sources said They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 1650 dlrs a barrel compared to its official price of 1742 dlrs Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter the sources said The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter It is lifting just 10000 to 15000 bpd They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices "If the spot price of Dubai goes above 1730 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price" one Japanese refiner said "We don't intend to put pressure on them" he added Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower oil traders said They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March The problem is likely to recur in April adding to that country's surplus The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement while agreeing to the fixed prices But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 158 mln bpd supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 1650 to 1720 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend One Japanese refiner said "At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC particularly on Qatar But if they hold out there will be no problem and I'm beginning to trust their ability" Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday "Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices" He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products reducing them to levels well below this time last year He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude A Japanese refiner said "The European and US Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky" Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to US exporters when he visits that country next month In an interview with Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on US beef and citrus exports Lyng who plans to be in Japan April 14-27 said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market "We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market" he said The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the US would request "We've got none of it now If we got one per cent of it it would be a big improvement" he said Last year the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the US rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions However the US said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to US rice exports Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas but that his visit "may be a forerunner in a general way" to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988 He said however that the US "will ask for a definite liberalization of those items (beef and citrus) When you translate 'liberalization' into Japanese it means do away with the quota" Electronics Corp asked the US Supreme Court to consider its anti-dumping case against Japanese television manufacturers In a complex case that dates to 1974 Zenith has charged a group of Japanese companies with violations of US antitrust and anti-dumping laws The US electronics company today said it asked the high court to review a 1986 lower court ruling that dismissed both the antitrust and anti-dumping portions of the case crushers bought 8000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for April shipment trade sources said Fund Inc said its board would recommend at its April 23 stockholders meeting that the Fund be converted to a no-load open-end fund If approved the Fund said a redemption fee of one pct of net asset value will be imposed on redemptions for a period of time not to exceed six months after open-ending It said such a redemption fee is designed to cover trasaction costs related to early redemptions and will remain in the assets of the Fund It said Shearson Lehman Brothers is serving as its financial advisor In a prepared statement Jonathan Mason Japan Fund's chairman said "open-ending which is timely given the expansion of the Japanese stock markets particularly in the last few years will eliminate the discount from net asset value and will afford investors the continuing opportunity for investment in Japan through the Japan Fund" Japan Fund said it proposed the conversion to an open-end fund after rejecting a takeover offer of about 525 mln dlrs from an investment group led by T Boone Pickens III son of the Texas oilman The investor group whose other members include <Sterling Grace Capital Fund LP> and <Anglo American Security Fund LP> could not be reached tonight for comment When it made its takeover offer on March 3 the group said it owned 14 mln shares or about 49 pct of the fund's outstanding stock Asked to comment on the rejection of the investor group's offer a Japan Fund spokeswoman said "The board decided that an open-end fund was preferable" The spokeswoman Davia B Temin said no other comments would be made on the offer She also declined to provide details on other options Japan Fund said previously that it would consider along with the takeover bid Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability Asked to comment on remarks by some US Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar Miyazawa said only the US President and the US Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates Finance Ministry will institute a study to consider changing the corporate disclosure rules to provide more information for investors a ministry official said The study will look at whether companies should include data on profits for separate divisions products and overseas regions in corporate earnings statements the official said At present companies give such breakdowns for sales only He said no time limit has been set for the study Japanese businessman Noboyuki Wakaoji is alive and well and may soon be released Cardinal Jaime Sin the archbishop of Manila said Wakaoji head of the Philippines branch of Mitsui and Co Ltd is being visited on a daily basis by a senior priest Sin told reporters at a briefing He refused to reveal Wakaoji's whereabouts The businessman was kidnapped last November and his captors have demanded a five mln dlr ransom from Mitsui Agriculture Ministry said it set Japan's beef import quota for the six months from April 1 at 93000 tonnes up from 83000 in the second half of 1986/87 and 85000 a year earlier Under an agreement with the US And Australia Japan has been increasing imports by 9000 tonnes a year from March 31 1985 to reach a projected 177000 tonnes in the year to March 31 1988 denied breaking a pact with the US On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the accord "We are faithfully abiding by the  Agreement but of course there are some problems" a spokesman for the International Trade and Industry Ministry told He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products "We are aiming to reduce production in Japan but of course this takes time" he said The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices but added: "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem" The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase US Semiconductor sales in Japan The US Senate Finance Committee this week called on President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate against Japan for violating the agreement Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura told a parliamentary session Japan's small- and medium-sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen's rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations Finance ministers of Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels The dollar had closed here at 15377 yen on February 20 shipbuilders have applied to the state's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year starting April 1 officials of the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said Under the plan 33 yards capable of building ships of more than 10000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against capacity of about six mln CGRT The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 33 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 31 mln the following year The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977/78 under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines The latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31 The cartels self-imposed and self-regulated are not legally binding but industry finds it in its own interest to stick to them The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump global links between futures markets mean that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) must add Chicago and London to its list of rivals banking sources said When SIMEX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) introduced US Treasury bond futures last autumn the sources expected to see fierce rivalry between the two exchanges ending with only one winner in Asia But surprisingly the challenges now appear to be coming from the other side of the world they said The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will introduce night trading in its US Treasury bond contract on April 30 which could clash with SIMEX morning activity banking sources said The CBOT had planned to introduce night trading on April 2 but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a US Treasury bond contract that can be offset on the CBOT they said Such a LIFFE contract is expected later this year LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX where average daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in February from 1286 last October when the bonds were first introduced The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the rapidly growing underlying cash market in US Treasury bonds in Toyko but interest has waned as that market has grown more stable traders said Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore and Sydney the banking sources said Nevertheless all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken with the last trading at 55000 dlrs against the initial price of 50000 dlrs The current bid is 55500 dlrs but offers at 65000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains said Michael Killian general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp Killian a SIMEX board member said the CBOT night session might raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end of 1987 SIMEX also became more competitive after this month's budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures margin deposits Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX trading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would benefit foreign firms and institutions While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat disappointing other SIMEX contracts continue to expand Fong Yew Meng SIMEX assistant general manager told Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index based on the Tokyo stock market has risen to a daily average of more than 1000 contracts this month from 320 contracts last October helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo stocks Fong said Open interest in the Nikkei contract introduced last year reached a record 2697 on February 26 Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential for expansion as overseas investors have been avoiding the contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising cash market in Tokyo SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts In February total volume on the exchange reached a record 122819 contracts surpassing the previous monthly record of 116767 set in September Eurodollar volume reached a record 78546 contracts last month against 70306 in September SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving into options soon but competition continues regionally as well as globally banking sources said The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which equity options are traded which could generate more liquidity than the ordinary index banking sources said Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may also

government to issue commemorative coins a Finance Ministry official said The bill which must still be approved by parliament would take effect in April 1988 It would allow the government to issue 1000 5000 and 10000 yen coins without special legislation although higher-valued coins would still need a special law the official said At present it can only issue coins of 500 yen or less Finance Ministry has clarified regulations governing fund management satisfying overseas critics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn ministry officials and Western diplomats said They said "double licensing" has been dropped so a foreign fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well A foreign investment management company will be permitted to employ only one fund manager in Japan with another on standby in the home country Domestic companies must have two In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm is eligible to manage funds in Japan the ministry will take account of the amount of funds the parent company has under management a ministry official said "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the criteria for a licence" he said without elaborating He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment management licences by the end of June Some 135 firms including some 15 foreign companies will probably be licensed under the new law passed late last year short-term effect of foreign exchange rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances appears to be waning and long-term efforts are required to cut Japan's chronic dependence on external demand the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report Japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain high in the near future the central bank said Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of resources and maintain the free trade system it added Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior US Government officials seeking to block the sale of a US Microchip maker to a Japanese firm "They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues" Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American Division told US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> US Officials said yesterday Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the US Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale US Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the US Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to US Sales Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division In addition Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to US Supercomputer makers they said Takemoto also dismissed US Fears that the proposed takeover would violate US Antitrust law saying "the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the US Semiconductor market" Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase industry analysts said The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more US Supercomputer sales they said US Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to US Supercomputer sales despite US Firms' technological lead in the field "The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied and this is a bullying ploy" Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said However the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the US Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors "The real issue is xenophobia in (the US) Silicon Valley" said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co US-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact "It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem" he told Despite the furore Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has refused to drop a proposed sales tax as debate on a draft budget for 1987 resumed after a nine-day opposition boycott "I have no plan to withdraw the sales tax as I think it is the best policy (for Japan)" Nakasone told the budget committee of the lower house of parliament Kyodo News Agency said a small group of members of Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party filed a complaint with their local headquarters calling for his expulsion from the party on the grounds he broke a campaign pledge by introducing the sales tax Nakasone admitted the tax was a major factor in an upper house by-election defeat for his party on Sunday The election was the first national-level poll since Nakasone presented his plan for overhauling Japan's tax system which has remained unaltered for the past 36 years The sales tax and the planned abolition of the tax-free saving system are designed to offset proposed income and corporate tax cuts agreed in talks with the US To amend its laws to allow more companies to engage in international value-added network telecommunications services a Post and Telecommunications Ministry official said Such services make communications between otherwise incompatible computers possible over telecommunications lines The official said firms registering as "Special Type Two Telecommunications Firms" which are those leasing lines from common carriers will be permitted to re-lease the lines to users and provide international services Steps will also be taken to assure fairness in negotiations between common carriers and firms seeking to lease lines the official said Since December 10 companies have registered as Special Type Two firms including two which have American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> or McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> as major shareholders the official said Currently only <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> and <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> are allowed to operate international telecommunications services Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major industrial nations last month does not necessarily mean the yen should stay stable around current levels in the future The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid fluctuation of exchange rates he said The accord stipulated that current rates reflect fundamentals of the six nations - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany securities houses have asked the Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of 10-year government bonds securities sources said Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses for 10-year bond auctions Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April Four US Banks are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they hold no more than 50 pct of the capital bankers said These firms are likely to join the syndicate which will increase the number of participants in the 10-year government bond primary market securities managers said Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the syndicate underwrites 007 pct of each issue they said In order to expand participation by foreigners the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share or introduce auctions to the primary market they said Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate now Fuji Bank Ltd to increase their share to 307 pct but banks oppose any cut in their 74 pct share bankers said personal savings grew 103 pct in 1986 from 1985 helped by a sharp increase in stock investments by individuals the Bank of Japan said Outstanding savings on December 31 1986 totalled 545303 billion yen Funds in investment trusts alone totalled 21918 billion yen up 374 pct from a year earlier The outstanding balance also included deposits at banks and post offices up 74 pct to 337867 billion yen savings in the form of insurance up 186 pct to 111431 billion corporate bond investments up 78 pct to 46867 billion and investments in trust banks up 41 pct to 27220 billion profits of Japan's major firms in the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5654 billion yen against a 26 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter the Finance Ministry said The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 225 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries supported by an 887 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate according to a ministry survey Total sales of the 15308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll fell one pct to 217217 billion yen against a 12 pct fall the previous quarter Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 137 pct to 2394 billion yen against a 221 pct fall in the preceding quarter the ministry said Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 39 pct to 8004 billion yen compared with a 14 percent fall the previoius quarter Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is heading for a recovery Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major industrial nations

Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said University and industry representatives will start discussions in April on basic research and possible applications Masatoshi Urashima MITI's director for development of future basic technology said Superconductors which conduct electricity with very low resistance could be used in computers semiconductors and high speed trains he said Urashima said recent discoveries of superconductive materials which do not need extremely low temperatures led to MITI's decision to coordinate research MITI's electric technology laboratory is currently researching energy efficiency and superconductive electrical generation he added cabinet has approved a bill making it easier for the government to issue commemorative coins a Finance

parliamentary session Japan's small- and medium-sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen's rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations Finance ministers of Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels The dollar had closed here at 15377 yen on February 20 Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability Asked to comment on remarks by some US Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar Miyazawa said only the

part of which will come from the Export-Import Bank of Japan Ltd the sources said Canada France Italy Sweden the UK US And West Germany are also involved they said Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range a senior central bank official told reporters He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions a dollar fall or a dollar rise Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks he said The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time the senior bank official said but declined to be more specific Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy Asked what factors might destabilize the markets the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan the US Or West Germany or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April That would be little changed from the performance expected this year Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88 but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point he said He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy he added The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy the senior bank official said The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation there could be some problems in the future he said "We are sitting on a barrel of powder but fortunately it may still be wet" he added Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially he said The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices the bank official said This inflow of funds into the stock exchange occurring also in other countries may continue he said The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year "He's a great man" the official said adding that more and more people expect his reappointment Turning to exchange rates the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through Even the US Trade position has begun to feel the impact although so far it has not been very strong he said to government plans to impose a five pct sales tax is spreading nationwide ahead of the start of campaigning for local elections next week political analysts said The Asahi Shimbun said 31 of the 47 prefectural assemblies had so far opposed demanded amendments to or expressed wariness about the tax Assemblymen from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have also joined the opposition against the tax in 11 prefectural assemblies the daily reported About 2600 elections will be held on April 12 and 26 for a wide range of local posts including 13 governors The sales tax is one of the main planks of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system A close aide to Nakasone has said the sales tax issue will have a minimal impact on the local elections because centrist parties by and large support LDP candidates in many of the races for governors In the assembly elections even LDP candidates oppose the tax he said On March 8 the LDP lost an Upper House by-election in the conservative stronghold of Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan for the first time in 25 years The opposition socialist winner campaigned on the single issue of the sales tax The surprise LDP defeat in Iwate coupled with Nakasone's sagging popularity has forced the party to compromise with the opposition and agree to postpone public hearings on the fiscal 1987/88 budget to March 19/20 from March 13/14 The opposition parties have been staging recurring parliamentary boycotts to show their disapproval of the sales tax contained in the budget They returned to the Lower House Budget Committee last Friday but walked out again after a few hours demanding detailed data on the tax But parliamentary sources said they are expected to agree in a day or two to dispose of some of 29 bills the LDP will submit The bills include nine which will become extinct on March 31 unless some action is taken the sources said These cover such uncontroversial topics as wages for diplomats and revisions of the law covering court employees Discussion is also expected of a provisional budget to allow the government to continue operating while debate on the main budget continues beyond the April 1 start of fiscal 1987/88 the sources said The provisional budget could cover some 50 days and include authorisation for spending on some public works Otherwise parliament will go into virtual recess until local elections start on April 12 they said Mining Co Ltd> said it will start commercial production of gold copper lead and zinc from its Nurukawa Mine in northern Japan in April A company spokesman said the mine's monthly output is expected to consist of 1300 tonnes of gold ore and 3700 of black ore which consists of copper lead and zinc ores A company survey shows the gold ore contains up to 133 grams of gold per tonne he said Proven gold ore reserves amount to 50000 tonnes while estimated reserves of gold and black ores total one mln tonnes he added extended decline in Japan's overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January-March quarter the Finance Ministry said Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic it said after carrying out a quarterly survey The survey conducted in February was based on questionnaires returned by 8328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 04 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 54 pct decrease in the first half Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987 rising an estimated 107 pct it added Manufacturers' earnings hit hard by the yen's steady rise against the dollar will rise 77 pct in first-half fiscal 1987 after falling 107 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986 it said Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise 118 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 98 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986 the survey said It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen's appreciation should step up the pace of its financial liberalisation if it wants to become a world financial centre equal to New York or London a leading US banker said "For Tokyo to become the third link in an international capital markets triangle it will need to create an environment more hospitable to international finance than currently exists" Robert Binney senior vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank NA Told a group of Japanese members of parliament and financial leaders Binney said Japan must liberalise its financial markets not just to attract more jobs capital and taxable income but also to recycle effectively its vast trade surpluses to help counter growing protectionism in the United States He called on Japan to remove all controls on deposit interest rates soon and to remove obstacles to the growth of its offshore market He also said it should fully deregulate its short-term money markets develop comprehensive futures markets further open the Tokyo Stock Exchange to foreign membership and remove fixed rate brokerage commissions Binney also urged Japan to abolish Article 25 of its Securities and Exchange Law which like the US Glass Steagall Act separates commercial from investment banking At the same meeting Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp president Eugene Atkinson urged Japan to fully de-regulate short-term interest rates introduce commercial paper and open long-term government bond markets to an auction system He said Japan should allow securities firms to participate in foreign exchange business and develop over-the-counter stock options and futures Short-selling of Japanese government cash bonds was a vital hedging mechanism he added The group of some 60 Japanese legislators and financial leaders which Atkinson and Binney addressed was recently formed to study ways in which Japan should promote liberalisation of its financial markets "We should not leave such matters solely to government bureaucrats" Masao Hori Chairman of the lower house finance committee told the group Corp <NESIT> may take legal action to halt introduction of <Seiko Epson Corp>'s NEC-compatible personal computer series which NEC alleges infringes copyrights for NEC's 9801 V computer series an NEC official said "We may have no choice but to take legal action" the NEC official said A Seiko Epson official said the company's PC 286 series the first NEC-compatible personal computer does not infringe on NEC copyrights He said the company intends to go ahead with plans to market the computers from late April A Seiko Epson official said of the new machine "It's compatible with NEC's machine so it appears similar But our intention was to develop an original machine" Industry analysts said NEC controls about 70 pct of the domestic personal computer market They said introduction of NEC-compatible machines could start a price war and cut NEC's profits as happened to IBM following the introduction of IBM-compatible machines Motor Corp <TOYOT> is likely to name more American companies as suppliers of car parts for its wholly-owned US Subsidiary Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA Inc (TMM) a Toyota official told Toyota is studying the use of General Motors Corp's <GMN> GM Delco Products as a supplier of motors for windshield wipers and Illinois Tool Works Inc for window handles he said Another US Firm may be used to supply radiator tanks Toyota had originally planned to use two Japanese companies to supply the parts Nippondenso Co Ltd <DNOTT> and Aisin Seiki Co Ltd Toyota is also considering some other US Firms as suppliers but the spokesman declined to name them Cars produced at Toyota's Kentucky plant will consist of 60 pct local content instead of an earlier planned 50 pct he said The plant is scheduled to start production in mid-1988 and have an annual capacity of 200000 cars Industry sources said the Toyota move was designed to head off criticism that it was not using enough US Company-made parts at its Kentucky plant Corp <BRITT> said it and <Clevite Industries Inc> of the United States will launch a joint venture in the US To produce parts for car engines The joint firm is to have a capital of 40 mln dlrs and will produce rubber for cushioning car engines from vibration Launch date for the company be owned 51 pct by Clevite and 49 pct by Bridgestone is to be in June banks may have to realize significant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetual floating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market bankers said How much of a loss is realized in the current fiscal year ending March 31 depends on the accounting treatment recommended by the Finance Ministry Ministry sources said the Ministry has yet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing the perpetual floating rate notes they hold The notes are held by Japanese city trust long-term and regional banks including their overseas branches Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset portfolios on the basis of current market prices while the others assess them at either the acquisition cost or the current market price whichever is lower bankers said With the market for such perpetuals non-existent Finance Ministry officials questioned the propriety of using nominal quotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determine bank book losses The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the National Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using such quotations one official said Banks using current market prices alone to value their holdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can argue that the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery next year bankers said But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign portfolios cannot look to the market bankers said The acquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price whatever it may be these banks must realize losses in the current fiscal year Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range a senior central

already written to his US counterpart special US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter outlining the EC's concerns The ministers' said they were "very disturbed" by the US moves adding "the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations" Any unilateral US moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) they said In a separate statement on Japan the EC ministers said they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade  (and) expect Japan to open up its market more" The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on US-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop "It wil be back on the table again and again" the diplomat said De Clercq told journalists "There is a certain nervousness a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan" But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he had no intention of modifying at the moment a proposed bill introducing a sales tax "Parliamentary deliberation must be conducted fully before we see whether to revise it or not" Miyazawa told reporters He also said he had not heard anything about Deputy Premier Shin Kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as he saw growing public opposition Debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic opposition boycott over their objections to the tax Miyazawa said he did not expect the bill to be altered even after Parliament completes its deliberations He also said the Government is undecided on the scale of a proposed provisional budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on April 1 The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than 1000 billion yen The Government is working on a provisional budget as the chances of passing a full one by April 1 are virtually nil as a result of the halt in parliamentary business officials said The Government wants to include as many economic stimuli as possible in the provisional budget to boost domestic demand increase imports and reduce its trade surplus they said overall wholesale price index (base 1980) fell 01 pct in February from a month earlier to 864 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall the Bank of Japan said Wholesale prices fell 06 pct in January from December The index fell 91 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year-on-year drop the central bank said The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the recovery in world crude oil prices it said On a customs-cleared basis crude oil prices rose to around 17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 08 pct to 15350 in February from 15467 in January and was up 168 pct from 18455 a year earlier the bank said The export price index in February fell 07 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition The index was down 71 pct from a year earlier The import price index rose 11 pct from a month earlier to 574 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier The domestic price index fell 01 pct to 919 in February its 24th straight monthly drop mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home Lower edible oil prices added to the decline The index was down 67 pct from a year earlier The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of 71 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected the bank said Bank Ltd's Hong Kong branch is planning a 40 mln New Zealand dlr certificate of deposit CD issue banking sources said The three-year CDs are denominated in 100000 dlr units and will carry interest at 375 basis points below the three-month New Zealand bank bill rate Payment date is expected to be around April 1 ANZ Securities Asia Ltd is lead manager for the issue Motor Corp <TOYOT> of Japan is expected to get approval from a Philippine government agency to produce cars and other items here government sources said This follows the company's proposal to invest about 400 mln pesos and generate about 100 mln dlrs in export earnings over five years The sources said Toyota is likely to be brought into the government-backed Progressive Car Manufacturing Program (PCMP) which since the 1970s has controlled the number of car makers The PCMP is administered by the Board of Investments (BOI) which screens investments by foreigners and locals The sources said Toyota had also applied to produce wiring harness hardboard and ferro-silicone for local and export markets It has not yet said what kind of cars it will make The sources did not say when BOI would announce its decision on the Toyota application In 1984 Toyota severed its ties with <Delta Motor Corp> its local partner for more than 20 years because the latter was suffering financial difficulties The state-owned Philippine National Bank later foreclosed on Delta's assets and the sources said Toyota is now negotiating to buy these The government sources also said Toyota was in the final stages of negotiations with a new local partner Toyota would be the third participant in the PCMP joining <Pilipinas Nissan Inc> and <Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> formerly Canlubang Automotive Resources Corp Two US Car firms General Motors Corp <GMN> and Ford Motor Co <FN> withdrew from the local car market shortly after the country was hit by a financial crisis in 1983 dollar sentiment is bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by said here "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 15000 yen and to fall even below that level" a senior dealer at one leading bank said The dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 15150 yen Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of US Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of US Treasury securities needed to finance the US Deficit Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further US Steps to weaken the dollar Under the Paris accord Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said If no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the US Congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said The factors affecting the US Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord they added "Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish US Economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank "There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 14000 yen by the end of this year" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the US Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 187 marks The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 160 dlrs on Wednesday they said But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars However First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said "The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March" Other dealers said the US Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of US Treasury securities US Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said Economic Planning Agency will announce gross national product (GNP) figures for the October/December quarter today at 1700 hrs local time (0800 gmt) Agency officials told In the July/September quarter GNP rose 06 pct from the previous three months European Community (EC) yesterday warned Japan and the United States its main trading partners that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations with both countries EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the US Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react The US Administration has already distanced itself from the bill EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his US Counterpart Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter outlining the EC's concerns The statement said ministers were very disturbed by US Moves towards protectionism "The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations" it said Any unilateral US Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it said In a separate statement on Japan the EC ministers said they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more" The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on US-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop "It will be back on the table again and again" the diplomat said De Clercq talking to journalists during the meeting said "There is a certain nervousness a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan" The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its trade surplus and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers where it has imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to use the exchange Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry approval the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at 1700 local time and will close the account for trading at the new session the following day before the opening call starts at 0930 local time an Exchange official said Trading on the Singapore rubber market a major producer price indicator for Japanese end-users is usually active after the end of the current final session here The introduction of the new session will enable participants to trade overnight after taking account of Singapore rubber prices because brokers and members who are designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume traded overnight to the new final session before the opening session starts next day the official said But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which sets a fixed price at each session the price of contracts traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth session he added Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures industry to expand and internationalise The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry TOCOM which also trades rubber futures in Japan said it has no plans to introduce an extra session TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day Four sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time broadly defined money supply average of M-2 plus certificate of deposits (CDs) rose a preliminary 88 pct in February from a year earlier compared with an 86 pct rise in January the Bank of Japan said The seasonally adjusted February average of M-2 plus CDs supply rose 08 pct from January it said Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs stood at an average 336000 billion yen in February compared with 337100 billion yen in January gross national product (GNP) rose a real 08 pct in the October/December quarter after an upwardly revised 07 pct increase the previous three months the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been put at 06 pct The annualized growth rate accelerated to 32 pct in October/December from 30 pct in July/September In the 1986 calendar year GNP rose 25 pct after a 47 pct increase in 1985 Last year's performance was the worst since 1974 when GNP fell 14 pct Agency officials blamed the strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry In nominal terms GNP rose 05 pct in the October/December quarter reflecting stable prices after a one pct increase in the previous three months the Agency said Domestic real demand increased 06 pct in October/December after a one pct rise the previous quarter Domestic demand contributed 05 percentage point to real GNP growth in October/December while foreign trade added 02 The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding In July/September domestic demand contributed one percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off 03 point Of the 02 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last quarter falling exports knocked off 02 while falling imports contributed 04 point Total export volume fell 12 pct quarter on quarter in October/December Imports also fell by 29 pct Of the 05 point contribution of domestic demand to October/December GNP growth the private sector accounted for 04 point and the public sector 02 The private sector contribution included 03 point for housebuilding 04 for corporate capital outlays and 01 for stockbuilding Consumer spending had a 04 negative impact government will find it very difficult to achieve its new gross national product (GNP) forecast of three pct growth in the fiscal year ending March 31 Economic Planning Agency officials said They made the comment to reporters after news that GNP rose 08 pct in the October/December quarter after a 07 pct increase the previous three months For Japan to achieve three pct growth in 1986/87 GNP in the January/March period would have to grow 26 pct from October/December the officials said The government lowered its GNP forecast for 1986/87 from four pct last December Ltd's <SLBN> decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> to buy 80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire US High technology firms but will not halt such attempts industry analysts said The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future US Expansion by the Japanese firm said analysts polled by "The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's North American operations but it would have been a great boost" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the US Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time The sale was opposed by the US Commerce Department and Defence Department partly on national security grounds Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology an area where Fujitsu is weak analysts said The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide eight of them in the US A report by the Capel firm said "It was an entry point a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology "(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a thing of the past" May said The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild's production lines Capel's Murtha said The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire US High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop analysts said Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the US Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm "It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains" said Capel's Murtha "The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable" Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale analysts said "They're not going to slow up they're just going to buy smaller pieces  Because of the political risk" said Barclays de Zoete's May Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller US High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers he said Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming US Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie-ups some analysts said "This is not really of benefit to US Firms either" said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards "The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it?" Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by US Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate "This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments' comment" Tamura said "I think it was improper for US Government officials to intervene to the extent they did" he said A spokesman told the ministry's view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of US-Japanese economic ties Bank of Japan will sell 300 billion yen of financing bills tomorrow under a 55-day repurchase accord maturing on May 12 money traders said The bills are meant to soak up a projected money market surplus due largely to coupon and principle payments of a previously issued Japanese National Railways bond The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39497 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate for two-month commercial bills and the 443/32 pct yield on two-month certificates of deposit today The sale will raise the bill supply to 1500 billion yen has complained to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules Trade Ministry officials here said They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more from the US And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers South Korea unveiled the plan in November It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991 South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 545 billion dlrs in 1986 and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods and to exporters to sell more to Japan The officials said they believed the Japanese action one step short of filing a suit was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April but the cutback ratio has not been set yet industry sources said Production prices the basis for setting intervention prices have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices they said Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values the sources added In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25 ministry officials said At present the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef known as marbled beef is 1400 yen per kilo while its ceiling is 1820 they said The standard price of other beef mainly produced from dairy steers is now 1090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1420 the officials said The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760 They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market Japan sets an annual beef import quota A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices they said ended January 31 Parent shr 573 yen vs 580 Div five yen vs same Net 701 billion vs 677 billion Current 2406 billion vs 2376 billion Operating 3762

shipbuilding orders received by Japanese yards in February rose to six vessels totalling 329999 gross tons from three ships of 79499 tons in January the Japan Ship Exporters Association said This compared with six ships of 125150 gross tons a year earlier an association official said The backlog of orders at end-February was 157 ships of 441 mln gross tons against 161 ships of 439 mln a month earlier and 265 vessels of 681 mln a year earlier an association official said tanker operator Japan Line Ltd <JLITT> said it will raise seven billion yen by issuing 6366 mln shares at 110 yen each to help reduce debt and restore profitability within two years Half of the sum raised will be returned to creditor banks which in December were asked to temporarily waive part of their loan repayments it said The other half will be used to bolster operations hit by the yen's steep appreciation and the global shipping slump the company added MORE Motor Co Ltd <HMCT> said it shifted production of motorcycles with engine capacity of 700 cc and bigger for sale in the US To its wholly owned subsidiary <Honda Motor of America Inc> in Ohio partly due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar A parent company spokesman said the Ohio plant which makes 360000 cars a year is now also producing 1100 cc and 1200 cc motorcycles partly for export Motorcycle output in Ohio totalled 28000 in 1986 down 33 pct from a year earlier but the shift in production will raise production to 44000 in 1987 the spokesman said The move to the US Of large motorcycle manufacturing was also due partly to higher US Tariffs for imported motorcyles bigger than 700 cc industry sources said The US Imposed tariffs on imports of large motorcycles from April 1983 starting at 499 pct and gradually falling to help the US Motorcycle manufacturing industry to reconstruct the sources said The tariff for US Fiscal year 1987/88 is set at 145 pct They said the US Planned to cut the tariff to 44 pct for fiscal 1988/89 but that the higher level is likely to be kept for a few years due to the slow pace of reconstruction Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> and Mitsui and Co Ltd <MITST> are likely to win an order for oil-related equipment worth about 600 mln yen this week from a Hungarian company trading in equipment for the chemical industry sources in the industry said The equipment developed by Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RDAS> removes water from carbonic acid gas which is injected into oil wells to increase oil production The sources said the Hungarian company Chemokomplex has asked the World Bank for money to buy the equipment Hungary gets 90 pct of its crude oil from the Soviet Union Iwai Corp> proposes to install a transport system built by Westinghouse Electric Corp <WX> of the US In Japan's six billion dlr offshore airport at Osaka western Japan a Nissho Iwai spokesman said It also proposed <Chiyoda Chemical Engineering and Construction Co> and <Hitachi Zosen Corp> install the unmanned system which will transport people between terminals He would not confirm a local report which said the system would cost about 30 mln dlrs The proposal is one of several being considered The US Europe and South Korea are pushing hard for greater foreign participation officials sought to convince the US That a US-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the US For them to prove their case "We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact" Osamu Watanabe Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division told foreign reporters "The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place" he said US Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States The agreement signed last September aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing US Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the US Side about the pact Watanabe said Yukio Honda director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market Honda said "The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now but in contrast US And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices" Honda said MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States he added The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter he said Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results Watanabe said "I am optimistic" he added Bank of Japan

bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by said here "The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 15000 yen and to fall even below that level" a senior dealer at one leading bank said The dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 15150 yen Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of

was set ablaze in the Persian Gulf yesterday after an Iranian gunboat fired missiles at it shipping sources quoting reports from Japanese tankers said today No casualties were seen and the tanker Pivot laden with crude oil was towed towards Dubai by tugs after they put out the fire the sources said Iranian gunboats usually check a ship's nationality and cargo before attacking but the Pivot was hit near Bu Musa island without warning they added Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986 private economists said Consumer spending a main driving force of domestic demand was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year the economists said They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 07 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 08 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 07 pct increase in the previous quarter It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 25 pct down from 47 pct in 1985 Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 14 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis They expressed concern about the 07 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off "Sure consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises" said Shoji Saito general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise Masao Suzaki senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor Without brisk consumer spending Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures he said Other economists said the 08 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector Johsen Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute said the 144 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins "This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter" Takahashi said Agency officials said public spending would have risen 11 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax of fish meal by the three South American producers -- Chile Peru and Equador -- last year reached 25 mln tonnes equalling the record output of 1970 the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers (IAFMM) said However IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean and Peruvian fish meal production in the first

Peru in the same month The statement added that due to technical market promotion and energetic sales by Chile and Peru the stock position at the end of the year remained reasonable Fish meal production outside South America decreased slightly falling from 114400 to 111100 tonnes The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West Germany Scandinavian countries Eastern Europe and the

affecting the EC's relations with both countries EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the US Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react The US Administration has already distanced itself from the bill EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his US Counterpart Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter outlining the EC's concerns The statement said ministers were very disturbed by US Moves towards protectionism "The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations" it said Any unilateral US Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it said In a separate statement on Japan the EC ministers said they "deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more" The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on US-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop "It will be back on the table again and again" the diplomat said De Clercq talking to journalists during the meeting said "There is a certain nervousness a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan" But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research told the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that South Korea's five-year import diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade governing body a Foreign Ministry spokesman said The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATT questionnaire on unfair trade practices the spokesman said In the five-year plan which starts this year South Korea aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the US And Europe Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan the spokesman said "The notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint nor is it intended to pressure South Korea It is a routine procedure followed by all other GATT member states" Holdings Plc <GLXOL> said it has filed an application to obtain a listing of its ordinary shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange It said in a statement it expects to obtain the listing by by the end of the company's financial year on June 30 No new shares will be issued in connection with the listing on the Tokyo exchange Glaxo said On February 18 Glaxo said it was seeking to list its American Depositary receipts now traded on the NASDAQ system on the New York Stock Exchange It also expected this listing to be in place by June 30 Treasury Secretary James Baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports the Treasury said The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries the Treasury said Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japan's willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese government's willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth a top Bundesbank official said Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies "can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective" He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald "an era of greater exchange rate stability" The Paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates Gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level "At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen" Gleske said He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong and further falls there may still be necessary But "a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value" he said In fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers Gleske said First in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses Second in the United States it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits Gleske said Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts "both within countries and between them" For instance the US Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones If target zones were established this would put "pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities" he said Gleske added "targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities" Commenting on the Paris currency accord Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained These chances "seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead" Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned "that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot" He said this "would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible" Monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said Inc said it is petitioning the International Trade Commission to lift import taxes on Japanese motorcycle manufacturers Harley-Davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to compete with the Japanese It said President Reagan imposed the tariff in April 1983 after Harley-Davidson convinced the administration the Japanese were eroding the US motorcycle industry by flooding the market with its own models Harley-Davidson said it has increased its market share of the heavyweight motorcycle to 194 pct in 1986 from a record low 125 pct in 1983 Reagan administration will consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive industries such as semiconductors and computers the New York Times said quoting an unnamed senior administration official "I think there's a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs" the paper quoted the official as saying "Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and computer companies" said the official who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> takeover bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry Officials told last week that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could have left the US Military dependent on foreign sources for vital technology The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas "Everybody wants an open investment policy but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest" Baldrige was quoted as saying The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency policymaking group such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security Council the strong yen has usurped "Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster" as Japan's favourite horror story The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15000 dlrs a month But "endaka" like many Japanese products is for foreign consumption locals and long-time foreign residents said "It's not really that expensive I don't pay attention to the cost of living" said Cheryl Richmond a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo Richmond said she earns 1635 dlrs a month by "chatting" 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku one of Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month She spends less than 650 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day "For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet pickles miso soup rice and tea" although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner No one argues that Tokyo is cheap but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2000 to 15000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes The companies feel otherwise They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets "You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down It's not reasonable" said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM) which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business travellers a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day While the businessmen have little choice but to come here many tourists especially those from Europe are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates "endaka" caused an 115 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year Those who came tried to cut back on expenses chiefly by curtailing shopping it said To help combat "endaka" and the slump in tourism the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet "Economical Travel in Japan" It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced business hotels and Japanese-style inns cheap sushi and public baths while getting a "revealing glimpse of Japanese in their daily lives" Residents of Okubo House a transit hotel in Tokyo's Shin-Okubo love hotel district offer even more savvy advice For 980 dlrs a night Scott Perry a 23-year-old budding English teacher from New Zealand shares an unheated berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese "flop house" Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for work "Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll splurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited pizza for at least two hours" Still there are the extras that dent the budget "I had to spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat" he said very strong earthquake which struck southwest Japan killed one person and injured at least three cracked walls and cut telephone lines authorities said The quake at 0336 GMT registered 69 on the Richter scale and officials issued warnings of tidal waves of up to two metres high they said A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truck overturned and another was seriously hurt when his roof caved in police said Two primary school children were hurt by flying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom The extent of their injuries was not immediately known A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki one of the worst hit areas said walls cracked all over town Weather officials told the quake's epicentre was 50 km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga on Kyushu's eastern coast Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen along the Kyushu coast to return to port and dispatched a fleet of six search boats to see them safely back Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted and all trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution police said US And European firms will be falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and eager to extend their reach further overseas according to merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Already rich Japanese companies have pounced on US Banks steel and other businesses In the latest attempt Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> a US Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSCT> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd <DSECT> Japan's two largest brokerage firms are seeking a niche in the US And European securities markets while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking the takeover specialists said Major trading houses which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists Among manufacturers car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore "The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses especially in the US -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal" a takeover specialist at one trading company said Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months But the yen's strength which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets has frozen Japanese corporate growth the specialists said Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work Domestic interest rates now at record lows offer little investment opportunity "Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous but the recent economic factors have become a driving force" said a banking industry source So far though the Japanese are being cautious While mergers and acquisitions among US Firms number in the thousands Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen one merchant banker said Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now but that time span appeared now to be too long Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now he said A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's <DIACT> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the US Last year which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile he added Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese the trading company official says "Japanese people don't like fighting They prefer peaceful amicable deals" But now after some experience overseas Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice he adds "This is a healthy progression" However the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant US Or European concerns "Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large US Or European corporation" one banker said "They will expand their operations only gradually a typical way for Japanese business" A foreign merchant banker also noted "There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States A lot of the big deals there have already been done" But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies the specialists said Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas "Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend" one takeover specialist said Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions If these succeed activity could build the specialists said But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins Already they said Japanese trading houses long-term credit and commercial banks brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) bond managers said "Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures" said Katsuyuki Okayasu general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division "But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market" said Tetsuya Dezuka deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd one of the most active yen bond brokers in London Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there dealers said Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140000 billion yen with most held in Japan they said An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link US Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago enabling a continuous 12-hour session bond managers here said adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last December But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets dealers said Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen but the extent of investor- linked transactions is unknown securities bond managers said "Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London suggesting they increasingly are engaging in not only fund raising but management there" Dezuka said The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of US And UK Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's growth dealers said Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year securities managers said The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the US Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract they said The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country Fundamental Brokers Inc a major US Brokers' broker has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April CBOT's start of an evening session planned for the end of April will also multiply yen bond futures trading a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market "Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE" said Koki Chiyojima deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's bond administration division Nikko Securities Co Ltd one of the big four Japanese securities houses is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September or June and December from April 1 matching futures delivery months The ministry now pays coupons in January June July and December When delivery months and coupon payments do not match a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-resident bond holders a deterrent to LIFFE securities managers said LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen bond managers said These bonds will be used for deliveries as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates they said Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987 Corp <SNET> group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen if the yendollar rate remains at the present level managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31 as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen down five pct from a year earlier he said The company earlier reported net income of 765 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31 down 592 pct from a year earlier on sales of 34306 billion down 63 pct The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen Hashimoto said Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300000 units in the three months unchanged from a year earlier while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300000 from 350000 Sales of compact disc players rose to 450000 from 300000 and those of the Walkman rose to 225 mln from 130 mln but colour television sales fell to 950000 from one mln due to lower exports to China Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986 Hashimoto said Overseas sales accounted for 682 pct of the total in the three months compared with 713 pct a year earlier Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen down 33 pct from a year earlier on sales of 400 billion down 12 pct Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987 he added The company made 419 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986 down 426 pct from a year earlier on sales of 1325 billion down 67 pct parliamentary boycott by opposition members has forced the government to compile its largest-ever provisional budget finance ministry officials said The 7900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of fiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3040 billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984 An on-again off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented passage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year ending March 31 The stop-gap budget which is expected to pass parliament on March 31 is designed to respond to mounting calls for economic stimulus from domestic industries hard hit by the yen's sharp rise officials said It will include as much as 1800 billion yen for public works about 30 pct of the 6000 billion yen earmarked for such works in the full budget Traditionally a provisional budget covers only day-to-day mandatory expenses The government also expects the budget to meet pressure from trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic demand they said The budget includes expenditures for a program to create 300000 jobs and other reflationary measures the officials said They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials yesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming as possible Economists said confidence of opposition members in their campaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their success in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could lead to even further delays in passing the full budget The result may be that the government will have to delay its planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in April economists said That package is expected to include a plan to carry out more than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first half of the fiscal year a government official said Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested Nakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April because of the sales tax confrontation Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan to prepare for the economic summit

Ministry said it will allow more foreign brokers to participate in government note auctions from April by abolishing a requirement that participants have current accounts with the Bank of Japan This will allow 18 more Japanese branches of foreign-owned brokerages to bid it said Currently 22 foreign brokers are allowed to bid Bidders for two three and four-year notes must be members of the underwriting syndicate for five-year discount notes and 10 and 20-year government bonds New tender participants are: Vickers da Costa Ltd; Bache Securities Ltd; Smith Barney Harris Upham International

Asia Inc Only these 18 Japanese branches of foreign-owned brokers would meet other existing requirements to participate on-off parliamentary boycott has forced Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to adopt a provisional budget government officials said Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it impossible for the full 1987-88 budget to be passed by the start of the fiscal year on April 1 government officials said and Wireless PLC <CAWLL> and the Pacific Telesis group <PACN> may take part in a proposed merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's international telecommunications market a senior industry official said Fumio Watanabe head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) told a news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums agreed that the US And British companies will be invited to participate in the new merged firm The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only one private company should enter the market The two consortiums <International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC) and <International Telecom Japan> (ITJ) were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985 Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct  Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house <C Itoh and Co> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MERN> jointly hold 13 pct  ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses Several firms including Toyota Motor Corp <TOYOT> belong to both Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the government on having only one private consortium as two companies might invest "excessive" amounts He said talks with Cable & Wireless will continue this week city of Rotterdam today signed an agreement in principle to cooperate with the AOMI Cargo Distribution Centre in Tokyo Acting Mayor Roel den Dunnen said that cooperation between private and public entities in the Tokyo and Rotterdam area and a fruitful exchange of information have a favourable influence on the flow of goods and services between the two countries The AOMI Cargo Distribution Center which will start operating in October this year signed a similar agreement with Rotterdam's twinned-port of Seattle last September Inc said it signed the previously announced agreements with Sumitomo Bakelite Co Ltd Tokyo Japan providing for a joint participation program for manufacturing flexible circuits and circuitry components Under terms of the agreement each company granted the other a license to use flexible circuit and related technology As part of the transaction Sumitomo Bakelite has purchased 10 pct or 325000 shares of Sheldahl common stock In addition Sheldahl will be a minority holder in Sumitomo's next flexible circuit manufacturing operation in Japan ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers industry sources told The salvage measures which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan the world leader has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages they said The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June the sources said They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment Last Friday the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1 The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month the sources said A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness they said Under the cartel proposals 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88 This is about half of total capacity This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost the sources said The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 31 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 33 mln in 1987/88 they said The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20000 to 30000 of the estimated 100000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989 Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December followed by South Korea and Taiwan according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping However falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry the sources said Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7 they said The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years the sources said In Japan no single yard leads the industry resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMAT> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built the sources said "World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world" said an official at a major Japanese shipping company The Japanese merchant fleet the largest after Liberia's has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships and this will encourage Japanese yards the sources said Express Co climbed 2-1/2 to 80-1/8 on rumors the company was about to announce an agreement to sell 10 pct of its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit to Nippon bLife Insurance of Japan traders said Speculation about an impending deal rumored to be worth 600 mln dlrs also sent shares of other US brokerages up sharply PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> gained 1-5/8 to 37-1/8 and Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> rose 1-3/8 to 42-7/8 American Express officials declined comment but cited a statement it released more than two weeks ago in which it said it was studying matters of strategic importance American Express officials also pointed out the earlier statement issued March one said it is company policy not to comment on rumors or speculation The earlier announcement also said American Express and Shearson were studying options including expansion of capacity to meet international competition and broadening access to capital The latest rumors originated in Tokyo traders said If the rumors are true "it gives them a nice infusion of capital for an attractive price" said Lawrence Eckenfelder analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Lehman Brothers Inc said it has sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to provide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to the US money markets The investment banker said its variable money market certificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating rate CDs with the rate based on the AA commercial paper composite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostly institutional investors The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and was oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were Sanwa Bank Ltd Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd each with tranches of 100 mln dlrs Shearson detailed The investment banking firm said another series of variable money market CDs is planned for April "The variable money market CDs provide a low cost dependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks" said Robert Shapiro executive vice president with Shearson Lehman Commercial Paper Inc "The instrument enables banks to diversify their funding base in a significant way" In yesterday's series the issuing banks' coupon rates were set at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which is expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis points Shearson said The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be subject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York Fed's commercial paper composite rate Shearson stressed however that the spread over the commercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be determined by investor demand It added that other Japanese banks may participate in future issues "For the first time they (the banks) will gain access not only to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper investors at rates which are competitive with traditional floating rate CDs" said Michael Balaban a vice president with Shearson's commercial paper unit He added "For US investors the CDs are attractive because they are domestically issued paper with competitive rates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks" Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money market funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank paper submitted bids during yesterday's sale Entertainment Corp said it has entered an acquisition and distribution agreement with Tokyo-based Gaga Communications to make and distribute home video titles in Japan under the Prism label Both companies will provide funding for joint acquisitions of up to ten mln dlrs Gaga is a subsidiary of Nihon Tape Corp Japan's largest wholesaler of pre-recorded cassettes Gaga will manufacture and distribute the videos for the Japanese market

overseas investment portfolio a company spokesman said But he declined to comment on rumours the company would take a 10 pct stake in <Shearson Lehman Brothers> an investment banking unit of American Express Co <AXP> He said the firm started to sound out several US Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago and was narrowing the number of prospects but he did not say if it had set its sights on one firm Nippon Life Japan's largest life insurer also plans to set up a wholly owned investment unit <Nissei International America> in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada Singapore the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year he said These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put more emphasis on overseas investment management as opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets are growing The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth of US Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm foothold there the spokesman added looks set to continue to provide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia and Australia this year A poll of property analysts bankers and economists around the region shows better returns are often more likely to come from buying and selling real estate than from rental income In central Tokyo property analysts project commercial land prices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's 538 pct jump The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan is Tokyo where the top price paid for a central commercial property last year was 169000 dlrs a square meter A building in land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3300 dlrs a meter But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply increases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach of foreign investors Japanese investors spurred by the yen's rise are spending record sums on property abroad partly elsewhere in Asia but in particular in the US Where Japanese investment could double this year to 10 billion dlrs the analysts said The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will rise steadily over the next few years although a surge in construction will limit increases in some areas Property sales have become increasingly popular because in some sectors of the market real estate prices as in several cities in the region have already outpaced rent yields "We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see why the trend should not continue over the next few months" said Gareth Williams a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong But he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk linked to the return of the colony to China in 1997 In several other countries analysts predicted at least some rise in property values which in one or two cases such as Thailand could help spark a construction boom Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least seven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a result of government assistance low mortgage rates and a generally bullish economic outlook Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the outlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump one Philippine developer said Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after five years in the doldrums according to property developers in Taipei They like counterparts in many of the region's capitals cited low interest rates as a major factor One leading broker said the property market had become an attractive investment in Taiwan noting property development yields of up to 15 pct Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers Construction has helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s though foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on property ownership as in many parts of Asia In contrast Australia's easing of rules on foreign investment in property combined with financial deregulation and a weaker dollar has helped spark overseas interest in the market analysts said But this has not always meant sales "What we have seen is an increase in inquiries particularly from Japan but this has yet to show itself in many new deals being done" said Allan Farrar executive director (real estate) of Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 65 pct and one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after 15 pct rises in each of the past two years customs-cleared trade surplus fell to 189 billion dlrs in the first 10 days of March from a 191 billion surplus a year earlier the Ministry of Finance said The March interim surplus compared with a 170 billion dlr surplus in the same February period FOB exports in the first 10 days of March rose 58 pct from a year earlier to 550 billion dlrs and CIF imports rose 97 pct to 361 billion The

<Allen-Bradley/TDK Magnetics> will be set up on April 1 at a plant formerly operated by Allen-Bradley's magnetics division in Shawnee Oklahoma It targets first-year sales of 30 to 40 mln dlrs which will be marketed by TDK's subsidiary <TDK Corp of America> TDK will own less than 50 pct of the venture the spokesman said without giving other details Osaka Stock Exchange has postponed its planned April 6 launch of a futures contract tied to stock market movements until after parliament considers a bill to cut tax on futures transactions an exchange official said Opposition parties have

of Goldstar's output due to start in July will be sold in South Korea he said However the Goldstar spokesman said Canon has agreed in principle to buy an unspecified number of cameras for resale in Japan under its own name he said without providing further details In Tokyo a Canon spokesman said that under the agreement Canon would sell facilities components and technology worth 15 billion yen to Goldstar in calendar 1987 and 35 billion in 1988 he said He said Goldstar plans to make 35-mm single-lens reflex cameras and 35-mm compact cameras at an annual rate of 70000 in 1987 and 200000 in 1988 The camera market in South Korea is expected to expand rapidly ahead of the 1988 Olympic Games scheduled to be held there the Canon spokesman said South Korean camera demand rose to 700000 in

Korean businessmen plan to resurrect a North Korean goldmine and boost annual output to almost one tonne within two years from 600 pounds at present said Li Sangsu a spokesman for <Unzan Mine Development Co> the venture partner Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70 billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies Li added "We expect this mine to be worth about 2000 billion yen in gold deposits" he said The mine started in 1896 by a US Company is one of six or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area 94 miles north of Pyongyang Li said Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would increase yields "Up to now the mining was done with antiquated methods and basic equipment" The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors Earlier this year Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off part of its debt with several tonnes of fish Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States MITI officials said The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1 The pact agreed last year calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus MITI anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export Last month the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct To meet that request they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year MITI officials who declined to be identified said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and US Competition just as markets there are picking up MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/US Chip pact Life

investment and technological transfers to Portugal he said Express Co said it and its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc subsidiary have been holding talks on the possible equity investment in Shearson Lehman by <Nippon Life Insurance Co> of Japan The company said "The discussions have led to a general understanding by which Nippon Life would purchase a 13 pct equity investment in Shearson Lehman for approximately 530 mln dlrs and American Express Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life would explore mutually advantageous nonexclusive business and investment opportunities" The company said a definitive agreement on the matter is subject to a number of conditions including approval of the American Express board and the Japanese Ministry of Finance The company said its board is scheduled to meet March 27 for its regular monthly sessions American Express said it is continuing to evaluate various courses of action of strategic importance to Shearson Lehman in addition to the possible investment by Nippon Life It said the options range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening further its access to capital The company also said "All the courses of action under study reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson Lehman in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy" results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies Results of the study which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries were provided to by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent PSE The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged 833 pct over 1979-81 with the European Community at 688 pct and the United States 482 pct For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 958 pct the EC 281 and the US 172 Japan's rice PSE was 688 pct compared to the EC 136 and the US 54 pct the OECD calculations show In coarse grains Japan's subsidies reached 1071 pct compared with 279 pct for the EC and 131 pct for the US Japan's beef subsidy was 549 pct versus 527 pct for the EC and 95 pct for the US OECD concluded For sugar Japan's PSE was 484 pct versus 279 pct in the EC and 131 pct for the US the study shows The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the US EC and Japan the sources said Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD work Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture However the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said The US Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84 In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD's in part because farm policies in both the US and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81 US officials said For example the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84 at 25 to 49 pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the US now because of increases since 1984 Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation The updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in US subsidy levels for sugar because the US imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry US subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice

to help stimulate US exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of US export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation" he told the Futures Industry Association Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period "Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery" he said Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners he said recent figures showed Japan's economy grew by about 05 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 "Not enough to sustain employment growth" However Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies including tax reform "I suspect there will be further moves" he said Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in US government spending and for resistance to tax increases "Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform" he said adding that "a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform" Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored US cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the US trade balance appeared to have abated However he said that "sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable" as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad "I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987" he said Improvements in the US trade balance he said will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present "serious adjustment problems for US trading partners" Western Europe where manufactures output and employment have been weak promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the US trade balance Sprinkel said He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them Express Co's plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit analysts said American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the US brokerage industry by Japanese concerns The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the US firm Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 27 times book value Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the US insider trading scandal closed out February at a market value of 18 times book value American Express was trading today at 78-1/4 off 3/8 For the last several weeks the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets "I think this in all honesty is a preliminary step" said Long "What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson" Long said "Normally investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation" he said of Nippon Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public They said the firm like other investment banks needs capital to expand globally American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally However that number is substantially lower than growth last year a company spokesman said American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning That statement however did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson David Anthony a Smith Barney analyst said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first "I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have" he said Joan Goodman an analyst with Pershing and Co also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public In its statement the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy Shearson follows Goldman Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner Goldman last year sold a 125 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion Analysts speculated there will be more such matches "Those (US brokers) companies have the expertise They don't have the money There's just not enough internal capital growth" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury who follows other US brokerage companies Hanbury said some Japanese companies flush with cash are interested in the expertise of American brokers "Those (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the money That's a nice marriage" he said Morgan Stanley and Co <MS> rose 4-1/4 to 74-7/8 First Boston Corp <FBC> was up one to 51-1/4 EF Hutton Group <EFH> rose

Reagan immediately to force Japan to live up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its markets to US Chipmakers The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties on Japanese high-technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as Japan's violations of the semiconductor pact While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue "We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan's unfair trade practices A key House trade lawmaker Representative Richard Gephardt also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget for the year starting April 1 An opposition boycott over a proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June Asked if he planned to visit the US To attend monetary conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in early April Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on the matter taking into account parliament debate The package is likely to include a record amount of public works spending in the first 1987/88 half Miyazawa said Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8800 billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1800 billion for public works Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help spur the economy Miyazawa said Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to the controversial sales tax without any revision Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks by a top government official as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that Miyazawa said customs faced with a flood of fake Reebok sneakers from South Korea have turned away some 100000 pairs since last summer Rebook officials said A Ministry of Finance spokesman said officials at the ports of Tokyo Osaka Yokohama and Kobe had begun barring counterfeit footwear but declined to say how many pairs A spokesman for Reebok Japan the local subsidiary of Reebok International <RBK> of Avon Massachussetts said the firm had complained of the influx to the Ministry last July "They use our trademark and everything And it's easy to fake our trademark" the Reebok spokesman said He said customs had sent back some 100000 pairs to South Korea but the Finance Ministry declined to confirm this "Because of various reasons we cannot say how many pairs have been turned away" the ministry spokesman said The Reebok spokesman said an unspecified number of fake Reeboks have made it into the country and were being sold at cut-rate prices in Tokyo and Osaka stores "They go for about 20 to 30 pct less than the price of genuine Reeboks" the spokesman said A pair of real Reeboks sells for about 10000 yen in Japan The government last summer warned stores not to carry the shoes and Reebok has sued two for continuing to sell them he said No action has been taken against the South Korean manufacturers he said Reebok has also found counterfeits from Taiwan and the Philippines aimed at the US Market and fakes from Spain targetted at European markets he said shr 1768 yen vs 2649 Net 1470

disasters scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said At stake is the ability of developing nations including Brazil Mexico and the Philippines to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals they said The experts gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week said the problem is already acute The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers "For many third world nations the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources" said Delfin Ganapin a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact "In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest now we have one mln We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left With a 26 billion dlr debt the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious" he said About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops Government security advisers say that as a direct result the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas said Ganapin Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival There is no known way to reproduce the wood or the millions of species within "No replanting programme has been successful" said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency Yet timber a five billion dlr a year industry is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests and nations must be educated in how best to "farm" them said Peter Kramer World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year he said US Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all US Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research develop and produce man-made substitutes at a cost which scientists say is incalculable By the year 2000 only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber from 33 currently and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 68 billion dlrs to less than two billion a World Bank and UN Sponsored survey said Of the 203 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank Inter-American African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84 only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects it said WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s Of 2000 mln hectares remaining up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers Finance Ministry plans to further ease restrictions on large-denomination bank deposits this year and is studying several deregulation plans a ministry official said without elaborating Banking sources told the ministry plans to lower the minimum denomination of money market certificates (MMCs) to 10 mln yen from 20 mln the amount slated to be applied from April 6 The amount is currently 30 mln yen The ministry is also considering shortening the minimum period of free-interest large-lot time deposits to one month from the current three months the sources said The Ministry plans to expand the issue period of certificates of deposits (CDs) to one week to two years from the current one month to one year the sources said They said banks fear the ministry's plans may induce a shift of funds from bank to other financial instruments One official of a major bank said the planned moves were unexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previously expected to have ended with the measures to start in April On April 6 the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimum time deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln and cut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one Agriculture Ministry said it revised its April-June sugar consumption estimate down to 623300 tonnes on a refined basis from 637800 estimated at the end of December It said the estimate for domestically produced sugar supply for the same period was revised to 190400 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 195100 tonnes while imports were revised to 402000 tonnes from the earlier 435800 tonnes It did not revise its sugar consumption estimate of 253 mln tonnes for the 1986/87 sugar year ending September 30 The ministry said the estimate for the 1986/87 year's supply of domestically produced sugar was revised to 881000 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 863000 The estimate for 1986/87 imports was revised to 1642 mln tonnes from an earlier 1645 mln tonnes Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLOAS> said it planned to pool world-wide sales and marketing of electronic test and measuring equipment with US Firm <John Fluke Mfg Co Inc> It said from this autumn Fluke will sell service and distribute Philips test and measuring products in North America and selected markets including China Hong Kong and Japan Philips will cover mainly European markets for Fluke The Dutch company said it will buy a minority equity stake in Fluke and name a board member Its equity holding will not exceed 10 pct Philips said The companies will also explore possible new joint ventures to develop new product lines Philips said It estimated the world-wide market for test and measuring equipment at six billion dlrs in 1986 Fluke had 1986 sales of 209 mln dlrs last year and Philips' turnover on test and measuring gear was of comparable size A Philips spokesman said the world leaders in the field were Hewlett-Packard Co <HWPAS> and Tekronix Inc <TEKN> with the combined operations of Philips and Fluke third leading industrial organisation said it will send its first buying mission to the US Later this year in an effort to reduce the country's trade surplus with Washington A spokesman for the Chinese National Federation of Industries told the mission was part of a broader plan to switch large purchases to the US From Japan The Federation groups all of Taiwan's major industrial associations Last year its members purchased about 45 billion US Dlrs worth of industrial products from Japan and about 18 billion from the US The spokesman said Federation members were now discussing the volume of business they could transfer to America He said they had drawn up a list of about 80 industrial products they would be shopping for in the US During the buying mission in September but he could give no figure on how much would be spent A Board of Foreign Trade official told the government would send two buying missions to America between June and July this year and might send others later Taiwan's trade surplus with the US Rose to a record 136 billion dlrs last year from 102 billion in 1985 US Senate has unanimously called for President Reagan immediately to force Japan to live up to a pledge to stop dumping its microchips and open its markets to US Chipmakers The Senate voted 93 to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties on Japanese high-technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as Japan's violations of the semiconductor pact While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue "We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter" Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan's unfair trade practices A key House trade lawmaker Representative Richard Gephardt also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus international monetary sources said At a meeting this week in Paris senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus they said Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen's sharp rise against the dollar they still tend to surge when growth picks up according to the OECD As a solution the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy they said That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members The United States which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan's fiscal stance joined in the attack he said The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government's forecast of 35 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1 Most independent forecasters including the IMF believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct monetary sources said The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise The yen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently The yen closed here today at 15153 to the dollar Most Japanese politicians including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa are clearly hoping the yen will weaken government officials said At a meeting in Paris last month Britain Canada France Japan the United States and West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels Officials said that wording represented a compromise Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months before it weakens later in the year Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar perhaps by substituting the word "recent" for "current" while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar's weaker levels now perhaps by use of the word "present" they said In the months leading up the February 22 agreement the dollar dropped some 10 yen The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent US Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 187 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the US Currency Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen Officials said there are already signs of that More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad they said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget for the year starting April 1 An opposition boycott over a proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June Asked if he planned to visit the US To attend monetary conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in early April Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on the matter taking into account parliament debate The package is likely to include a record amount of public works spending in the first 1987/88 half Miyazawa said Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8800 billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1800 billion for public works Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help spur the economy Miyazawa said Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to the controversial sales tax without any revision Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks by a top government official as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that Miyazawa said Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD is still under way and will be completed sometime next month The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far and they said Japan would comment on the final results A report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study the agriculture ministry officials said OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81 Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then partly because of tight budgetary policy and foreign currency factors have also changed he said "The study is  Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country such as geography" the source said He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world "This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy" he said without giving further details A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community but Japan is a major importer he said will liberalize rules restricting their financial institutions' ability to trade foreign financial futures contracts within the next two years Leo Melamed director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's CME's executive committee said Melamed also the head of Dellsher Investment Co Inc told a press conference yesterday at the Futures Industry Association convention that within the next year or two the Japanese government is "going to lift the curtain on their community of users" of futures markets Currently government restrictions prevent Japanese citizens from trading futures or options contracts off-shore and converting the profits back into yen according to Richard Heckinger CME's vice president for international marketing In addition Japanese are not allowed to convert yen into dollars for the purpose of trading futures contracts overseas he said Melamed predicted the Nikkei stock average index future -- a price-weighted index future based on 225 Tokyo Stock Exchange issues which is traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and mutually offset at the CME -- would do much better if Japanese financial institutions were able to use it CME is waiting for approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to begin trading the Nikkei stock index future in Chicago "We will not do as well with that contract until or unless the Japanese community financial institutions can utilize it in Chicago" Melamed said Melamed and Heckinger said they had no firm evidence that Tokyo would liberalize futures trading rules but sensed from Japanese inquiries and visits a readiness to change Next month the CME is to open a Tokyo office to strengthen the exchange's link to Japan The managing director of the office will be Takeo Arakawa formerly of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Tokyo Melamed said he hoped Arakawa would help the CME maintain a competitive edge when Japan launches financial futures trading Next month the Osaka exchange is set to begin trading a stock index future Heckinger said "We are not going to let them (the Japanese) do what they did to the American automobile industry We want to be partners with them" Melamed said and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans a company executive said Cable and Wireless which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters That plan put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market Pacific Telesis Group <PACN> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia <International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC) Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger A key US Senate committee Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger he said The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm In an attempt to hammer out an agreement Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger But the two sides remained deadlocked At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska to form part of its global network "C and W wants to start right away on the project such as application and other procedures" said Watanabe who is also chairman of <Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc> The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm after the merger "These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems I told him we are not a colony or something" said Watanabe has agreed to drop barriers to American-caught herring and pollock opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo He said the Commerce Department estimated US shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years There was no immediate assessment of the value of current US shipments but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms At the same time Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement Finance Ministers from the Group of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to discuss the world debt crisis trade imbalances and currency stability today following last month's Paris monetary accord sources close to the talks said The officials met at the offices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary policy in preparation for the IMF's interim committee meeting in Washington in April The talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the US West Germany France Britain Japan and Canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985 Other countries represented at today's talks were Italy which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions the Netherlands Belgium and Switzerland Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr US Trade deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their economies to more foreign imports Bakelite Co Ltd a Japanese company told the Securities and Exchange Commission it has acquired 325000 shares of Sheldahl Inc or 107 pct of the total outstanding common stock Sumitomo Bakelite said it bought the stock for 49 mln dlrs for investment purposes Under an between Sumitomo Bakelite and Sheldahl as long as its stake is more than five pct Sumitomo said it has preemptive rights for 60 days following notice of issuance of new Sheldahl common stock As long as its stake is over 10 pct it said it is entitled to Sheldahl board representation Bank President Barber Conable said he believed Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt interest payments is temporary Conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown on public broadcasting tomorrow said Brazil now has the attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan designed to reform its economy "I think the Brazilians have the attention of many of their creditors but they must come up with a plan that will persuade people that the Brazilian economy is going to be put on a course that will result in some growth" Turning to Japan Conable said the role of that country has been increasing in the World Bank and is expected to continue to do so He said that Japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr pledge to the International Development Association an indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in line with its economic position Conable said there was no indication that the Soviet Union was serious about joining the International Monetary Fund and World Bank He said they would have to get convertible currency and open their books and the Soviets "don't usually do that" United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties President Reagan's trade policy advisory group of which Baldrige is a member will meet on the issue Wednesday "I am confident we will see action taken" Sen John McCain an Arizona Republican told reporters "I am expecting sanctions at least and even more than sanctions" Sen Pete Domenici a New Mexico Republican said The senators several congressmen and US semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry they said Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions Sen Pete Wilson told reporters "The clear import of what he said is that there will be" "Japan can't just say they will comply We think sanctions must be applied" for past violations of the agreement the California Republican said The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems Sen James McClure an Idaho Republican said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries But McClure said senators told him "There is no doubt dumping is going on" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the US semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market In return the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep Bob Matsui a California Democrat public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 15 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered police said The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June 1985 Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet The company established here in 1981 undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7000 employees at its peak in early 1985 Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30000 clients many of them pensioners and housewives before the firm went bankrupt in July 1985 according to lawyers Of them some 18000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen local press reports said Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa 47 former Toyota Shoji president and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 15 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy they said Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint investigation by the public prosecutors and police who had questioned about 3000 of the firm's former employees police sources said long-term banks will soon cut their prime rate now at a record low 55 pct by 02 or 03 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five-year debentures long-term bankers said The long-term prime rate is customarily set 09 percentage point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued by the long-term banks every month The latest bank debentures at 46 pct have met strong end-investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates dealers said The current 55 pct prime rate has been in effect since February 28 United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade especially over semiconductors Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy US Super-computers and barriers to US Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC the US And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is maybe five or six years in the future" He also said he did not consider the new US Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago "That's a very healthy development" he added"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist" "Members of Congress that is the contemplative members of Congress have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit" Yeutter said "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and in my judgement more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago" He added "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter" vehicle output in February fell 04 pct from a year earlier to 103 mln units for the fifth consecutive monthly year-on-year drop but February output was up 10 pct from a month earlier the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) said February car production totalled 651253 units up 04 pct from a year earlier trucks 375899 down 18 pct and buses 4230 up 103 pct he said Vehicle exports are expected to show a seven pct year-on-year drop in February when figures are announced on March 27 a JAMA spokesman said The JAMA spokesman blamed slow sales to southeast Asia the Mideast and other countries except the US And Europe February motorcycle output fell 329 pct from a year earlier to 224312 the 13th straight year-on-year drop but was up 42 pct from a month earlier he added Motorcycle exports are expected to show a 26 pct year-on-year fall in February he said German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month's Paris pact extend to keeping down European interest rates banking economists said But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy they said The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling US and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April "The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant They mark an uncoupling of movements in US and foreign interest rates" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the US not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point to avoid weakening the dollar West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline "It's not a taboo" Peter Pietsch spokesman for Commerzbank AG said But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low Last week yields fell to around 550 pct not far from the 1986 low of 535 pct posted in mid-April Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet US demands for faster West German growth This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending Josef Koerner chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 52 billion marks to 144 billion West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 219 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 148 billion in fourth quarter 1985 The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended his tax reform plans from fierce opposition even within his own party as campaigning for local elections began "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong Unless we reform the system now Japan is bound to decay perhaps within the next 10 years" Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax one of the main planks in the tax reform package and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies In Tokyo incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax which Nakasone proposes to implement next January into consideration when they vote Takako Doi Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)" The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures A close aide to Nakasone who asked not to be identified said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates irrespective of party affiliation are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls compound feed output fell to 206 mln tonnes in January from 257 mln in December against 204 mln a year earlier Agriculture Ministry statistics show January sales totalled 207 mln tonnes against 259 mln in December and 204 mln a year earlier while end-month stocks were 233003 tonnes against 230764 and 241567 Base mixes for the January compound feed output included corn sorghum and soybean meal Corn use totalled 993156 tonnes against 120 mln in December and 896718 a year earlier and its compounding

trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved Hata speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy but did not elaborate Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever reflecting financial deficits payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries Despite great potential developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties particularly debt he added The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este Uruguay and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva "It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled" Hata said Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others In order to rebuild the free trade system it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end As part of its contribution Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market more open to developing countries he said Corp <MARTT> said it won a 30 mln dlr contract from China to set up a broiler raising and slaughtering plant in Tianjin under a countertrade accord in which payment will be made partly by output from the plant The plant which will be completed by end-1988 will have a capacity of five mln broilers a year most of which will go to China's domestic market a company spokesman said without giving further details The spokesman said Marubeni plans to increase its countertrade with China by helping China set up farm product processing plants and improving its food distribution system Marubeni will also help China develop export markets for farm products he said The company wants to increase its food trade with China to around 200 mln dlrs a year within a few years from 70 mln now he added moderate earthquake measuring 55 on the Richter scale shook southwestern Japan but caused no injuries or damage police said The tremor recorded at 1358 local time (0458) had its epicentre about 50 km offshore from the city of Miyazaki on the western Japanese island of Kyushu they said It affected almost the same area as last Wednesday's strong earthquake which killed two people and injured at least three they said is expected to post a 36 pct rise in real gross national product in 1987/88 higher than the official 35 pct target a private economic institute said The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the US Economy Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to 902 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated 98 billion in the current fiscal year it said Corp <TSBAT> said it has set up a design centre for large integrated circuits (LSI) in Hong Kong The centre located at its wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary <Toshiba Electronics Asia Ltd> will start operations to help create new demand for semi-customized LSI from April 1 Toshiba has nine LSI design centres in the US Europe and Japan REUETER long-term banks will soon cut their prime rate now at a record low 55 pct by 02 or 03 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five-year debentures long-term bankers said The long-term prime rate is customarily set 09 percentage point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued by the long-term banks every month The latest bank debentures at 46 pct have met strong end-investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates dealers said The current 55 pct prime rate has been in effect since February 28 United States and Japan are on the brink of serious conflict on trade especially over semiconductors Japanese unwillingness for public bodies to buy US Super-computers and barriers to US Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC the US And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years "Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is maybe five or six years in the future" He also said he did not consider the new US Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago "That's a very healthy development" he added"If you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist" "Members of Congress that is the contemplative members of Congress have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit" Yeutter said "They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and in my judgement more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago" He added "Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter" has assured a meeting of trade ministers it is making every effort to expand domestic demand and restructure its economy Japanese trade representative Tsomu Hata told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved Hata speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy but did not elaborate Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever reflecting financial deficits payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further "We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters "If hasty action is taken in the United States it will create very serious problems" The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year Under the pact Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports and has threatened to take retaliatory action In an effort to save the agreement MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market "We have almost no grey market" he said "Supply is diminishing" To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker NEC Corp <NIPNT> last week he said It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of <Texas Instruments Inc> Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for US Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers The letter was sent today to US Secretary of State George Schultz Treasury Secretary James Baker Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter The four who make up the Economic Policy Council are expected to consider evidence presented by US Chip maker Micron Technology Inc <DRAMO> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices "If the United States uses this as proof of dumpingWe will present our rebuttal" he said The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping he said He also called the case "strange" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended his tax reform plans from fierce opposition even within his own party as campaigning for local elections began "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong Unless we reform the system now Japan is bound to decay perhaps within the next 10 years" Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax one of the main planks in the tax reform package and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies In Tokyo incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax which Nakasone proposes to implement next January into consideration when they vote Takako Doi Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)" The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures A close aide to Nakasone who asked not to be identified said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates irrespective of party affiliation are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will ask the Japanese Government to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits there next month Lyng's remarks came in a speech at Oklahoma State University today "We think Japanese consumers should have the same freedom of choice as our consumers Look at all the Japanese cameras and tape recorders in this room We know they'd buy more beef if they had the opportunity" Lyng said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris In Paris Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning piercing the 150 yen barrier Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris In Paris Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning piercing the 150 yen barrier Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch break dealers said They said the bank seemed more determined to support the dollar than it did this morning Several dealers said the central bank intervened this afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half-hour since the market re-opened after its lunchtime closure Another said the bank still has buying orders in the market into materials that conduct electricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gains on Tokyo's booming stock market brokers said They said the share prices of companies likely to benefit from the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last week after publication of articles about the research in the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun The companies were in the non-ferrous metal electrical and mining sectors But industry analysts said development problems remain and commercial application is still some years away "The area clearly has significant applications but it won't be commercially viable for a few years" said Thomas Murtha technology analyst with James Capel and Co Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could bring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can be overcome Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said superconductors could have applications in computer circuitry electricity generation and storage and scientific research The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in a heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWST> predicted in an in-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth 150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers 50 billion for those used in electricity generators and 150 billion for those used in electricity storage The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable of 500 km an hour hovering on a magnetic field and powered mainly by superconductors One hundred billion yen worth of superconducting material would be needed for such a train The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used in nuclear fusion physics but not until the year 2000 Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial applications at present In laboratory tests the conductor must be cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum electrical resistance is achieved though liquid nitrogen which is much less expensive has recently also been used successfully they said Despite this investors on Tokyo's stock market have boosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's close Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's <MIMIT> share price rose 140 yen to 485 yen In the same period Mitsubishi Metal Corp <MITMT> rose 95 to 745 yen Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd <TOMMT> rose 200 to 1440 yen and Kawasaki Steel rose 15 to 260 Furukawa Electric Co Ltd shares <URUTT> jumped 104 yen to 689 yen and Fuji Electric Co Ltd <FUJET> rose 141 to 619 Brokers said shares of suppliers of scientific instruments needed to conduct the superconductor research also rose Industry analysts said the most favoured superconductor made from a blend of yttrium barium and copper is currently undergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the US Over semiconductor trade government officials said At today's Cabinet meeting Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm US Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the US That pact agreed last year after months of negotiations calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of US Semiconductors Senior US Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action Yesterday Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to US Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output In his letter the contents of which were released today Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets In a separate letter sent to senior US Officials MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention if necessary in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations Canada Britain France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 14840 "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates" Sumita said The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system he said The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries the Paris statement said Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining US-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United StatesThe relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date" he said "I am not sure we can wait until late April" he added Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy US Super-computers and the barring of US Firms from the eight billion US Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country "I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction The question is how far and how fast" Yeutter said dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates senior foreign exchange dealers said Following its fall today to a record 14840 yen dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down the dealers said "The recent remark by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement" said Koji Kidokoro general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division He said the market interpreted this as indicating the US Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency "This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention" Kidokoro said Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency They said the central bank bought between one to 15 billion dlrs today including direct purchases through brokers and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the US Central bank in New York Most dealers said they doubted the US Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen "If the dollar drops to that low level it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into US Securities which the Americans don't want" said Haruya Uehara chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31 But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish This was due to the lacklustre performance of the US Economy the continuing US Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package "The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy" said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and thus reduce its trade surplus The package was expected in April but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the US Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow securities analysts said The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position they said "It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions" said Simon Smithson an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo The investment in Shearson Lehman a growing firm described by some analysts as the top US Retail brokerage will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 902 billion dlrs they said Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan they added The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management market research and consulting on financing Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor analysts said The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a US Financial firm The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year Since then they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments Last year a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to EF Hutton Group Inc unit EF Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman Sachs and Co Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984 "But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations" he said "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co "With a historically high yen and historically low interest rates there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan" Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings The typical salaried employee has 733 mln yen in savings reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct he said To stay competitive fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation "The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management" Smithson said Corp <SNET> said it will set up a second wholly-owned subsidiary in Malaysia to make headphones car stereos radios and radiocassettes from early 1988 <Sony Electronics (M) Sdn Bhd> in Penang will have initial capital of about 25 billion yen and provide 1000 jobs Sales worth 10 billion yen are targetted for the year from April 1 1988 mainly to the US And Europe Sony's wholly-owned <Toyo Audio (M) Sdn Bhd> in Penang has made audio products for export to the US And Europe since 1984 Toyo sales were four billion yen in the year to October 31 1986 Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament's Lower House Finance Committee that the US Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates political sources said Asked if the US Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates Miyazawa said yes the sources said Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges Motor Co Ltd <SZMTT> is negotiating a joint venture with Hungary to assemble compact cars there following a request from its government the first entry by a Japanese car maker into a Communist country a Suzuki spokesman said The company in which General Motors Corp <GMN> has a 49 pct stake has to set up such projects to avoid cutting component production in Japan Existing overseas vehicle projects are increasing local content and so using fewer Japanese parts the spokesman said Its Indian joint venture <Maruti Udyog Ltd> MUL 26 pct owned by Suzuki will reduce component imports from Japan as it increases local content to 60 pct from the present 40 pct in 1987 the spokesman said The yen's continued rise against the dollar and Japan's self-imposed restrictions on exports to the US And Europe were also to blame for cuts in car component manufacture in Japan he said private sector investment in plant and equipment is expected to grow a real 09 pct in 1987 after an estimated 55 pct rise last year the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd said It said its survey of 1169 companies at the end of February showed that manufacturing industry investment will decline eight pct this year while non-manufacturing will increase 57 pct It did not provide figures for 1986 The bank partly blamed the expected deline in manufacturing investment on the uncertain outlook for demand in those industries The Long-Term Credit Bank also said that steelmaking and shipbuilding companies are putting a squeeze on maintenance and repair costs for their facilities and equipment In non-manufacturing industry growth in investment is expected to be particularly marked in the wholesale and retail store area 124 pct as new department stores and supermarkets are built and old ones are remodelled The Bank though expressed concern at a slowing of corporate investment that would help restructure the Japanese economy and urged government deregulation and other action to offset this Bank of Japan

industrial production down 05 pct in January from December is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 25 pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 07 pct in the previous quarter A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 27 pct the officials said They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels the officials said They predicted exports will increase by 23 pct in the January/March quarter from the October/December quarter "But the problem is imports are not expanding" said one official Imports fell by 94 pct in February from January Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament's Lower House Finance Committee that the US Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates political sources said Asked if the US Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates Miyazawa said yes the sources said Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining US-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United StatesThe relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date" he said "I am not sure we can wait until late April" he added Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy US Super-computers and the barring of US Firms from the eight billion US Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country "I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction The question is how far and how fast" Yeutter said of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention if necessary in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations Canada Britain France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 14840 "It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates" Sumita said The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system he said The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries the Paris statement said sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies dealers and bank economists said "The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention" one dealer for a German bank said echoing widepread sentiment in the market But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today It was quoted as low as 14840 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the US Currency to decline further "The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range" Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop "Window-dressing" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the US Currency Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical US Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the US Administration to talk the dollar down "Suddenly support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared" one dealer said The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 15 billion dlrs and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge dealers said Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan Britain Canada France the US And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 180 marks others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 175 marks or if the decline accelerated The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27 when the dollar threatened to fall below 181 marks "The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment" one dealer said Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done Some said Baker's remarks and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the US And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift "It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands" a dealer said Another added "If the Americans do not get what they want they will push the dollar down regardless of G-6" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter "It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary US Fiscal contraction" Citibank said It added "Markets should therefore be aware that 180 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 170 marks or even less is expected this year" And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report "We are looking for a further more gradual fall possibly to 160 marks by the end of the year" But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments "There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down" a senior dealer said strong earthquake registering a preliminary reading of 65 on the Richter scale was felt on the coast northwest of Tokyo today the Central Meteorological Agency said There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries but the agency issued a seismic wave warning on the coast between Niigata Prefecture northwest of Tokyo and Noto Peninsula to the west The epicentre of the tremor was located in the Sea of Japan far off Niigata it said The tremor was felt as far away as Yokohama south of Tokyo and Hamamatsu on the Pacific coast Federal Reserve appears to have intervened in the US foreign exchange market to buy dollars against yen this morning currency dealers said They said the intervention occurred near the dollar's early low of 14850 yen and the US currency subsequently firmed to 14905/15 It closed at 15000/05 on Monday Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Fed's purchases were for its own account or for a customer But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today Street's biggest brokerage firms eager for funds and foreign ties to fuel international expansion are expected to find more partnerships among Japan's cash-rich companies analysts said Yesterday American Express Co's <AXP> board formally approved a linkup with <Nippon Life Insurance Co> for itself and its <Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc> brokerage unit Nippon Life will receive 13 pct of Shearson for 538 mln dlrs Nippon Life's investment in Shearson follows last year's investment by <Sumitomo Bank Ltd> in <Goldman Sachs and Co> Sumitomo paid 500 mln dlrs for 125 pct of the firm "There certainly is potential for additional investment or further linkups with other Japanese financial institutions I think the pattern has established itself here and it's reasonable to expect further investment down the road" said Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Larry Eckenfelder Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokerage stocks resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions "The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution of the value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going to be a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the US" said another analyst As globalization of the financial markets accelerates Japanese firms are expected to turn their sights on the expertise of the US brokerage industry Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian market and Europe has also created a craving for more capital by US firms "Morgan (Stanley) First Boston Salomon (Brothers) Merrill (Lynch) Those would be the firms more likely to consider hooking up with a Japanese firm and those would be the ones the Japanese would be most interested in" Eckenfelder said All of those firms he said have been establishing themselves in Japan While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably there is some underlying concern that Japanese companies may learn enough from their US partners to ultimately pose the same type of competitive threat they have made in electronics and automobiles "The difficult issue is what investment really will lead to as markets deregulate Passive investment is an education gathering period Obviously there are regulatory barriers toward exercising management control" said Samuel Liss a brokerage industry analyst with Salomon Brothers The Nippon purchase of a stake in Shearson must be approved by US regulators and the Japan Finance Ministry There will also be a public offering for 18 pct of Shearson Nippon and Shearson have already said they would form a joint venture company in London to work on investment advisory asset management and consulting on financing Analysts believe Nippon has willingly paid a premium for its stake but it will also receive warrants for one mln American Express shares and the 13 mln shares in Shearson will be cumulative preferred convertible to common after US regulatory approval is granted American Express has also guaranteed it will retain a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until 1990 American Express and Nippon are also expected to work closely For instance analysts expect it to market the American Express card more actively in Japan with the help of Nippon "The key to the deal is not just raising capital for Shearson but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon" said Alan Zimmerman of Kidder Peabody and Co American Express stock responded favorably to the announcements climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaining a foothold in the US market with the help of American Express and Shearson Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager to follow Nippon Life US insurers have found numerous partners themselves in the brokerage industry For instance Equitable Life Assurance Co owns Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp and Prudential Life Insurance Co owns Prudential-Bache Securities Inc Eckenfelder said Japanese brokerage firms would not be likely acquirors of US firms for the time being although they have often been rumored suitors in the past Last year when Shearson unsuccessfully courted EF Hutton Group <EFH> Japanese firms were also rumored to be willing partners member of the Federal Reserve Board Robert Heller said he wanted to see stronger Japanese demand for American goods "What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of American goods" Heller said in response to a question about the dollar's weakness in currency markets He told a Heritage Foundation forum "I'd be very happy to see that" In his formal remarks Heller said he supported the idea of using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting he said "Even at previous meetings commodity prices were raised" He added "I would not expect future meetings to be different from past meetings in that respect" The House today supported a call for Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the world including in the Gulf House member approved a measure that would require Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of its gross national product The measure passed during consideration of the 1988-89 State Department funding bill would not require an increase but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense The Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law We don't have to bash the Japanese We have to show them how to share the burden of the defense of the free world said Rep Robert Dornan a California Republican The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the United States as a kind of security fee Finance Ministry is still asking financial institutions to limit speculative dollar dealings Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters He was responding to rumours in the New York currency market overnight that the Ministry was reducing its pressure on institutions to refrain from excessively speculative dollar dealings Electric Corp <MIETT> plans to assemble personal computers in the US To counteract the imposition of a 100 pct import tax in April and a drop in profits due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar a company spokesman told It will assemble 16-bit MP-286 and 32-bit MP-386 desk-top computers at its wholly-owned computer and computer-related equipment sales unit <Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc> in Torrance California at a rate if 10000 a month he said This will include 2000 TO 3000 to be sold

Province (PTABF) China to develop and sell software for the Fujitsu-designed digital telephone switching machine FETEX-150 It said in a statement the joint company <Fujian Fujitsu Communications Software Ltd> located in Fuzhou city was capitalised at about 10 mln yuan and was owned 51 pct by PTABF and 49 pct by Fujitsu It would create about 20 local jobs and has a target of annual software

international fund management a ACMII spokesman said MIMCL 55-pct controlled by affiliated companies of Mitsui Bank Ltd <MIBTT> will reconsign some of its foreign securities investment orders to ACMII he told ACMII the London-based 100 pct-owned subsidiary of <Alliance Capital Management Corp> of New York will reconsign some of its foreign orders to MIMCL and instruct MIMCL in international fund management techniques the spokesman said Both firms were among 56 investment advisory companies granted Japanese government approval for discretionary fund management on June 10 the Mitsui spokesman said Alliance Capital Management Corp is the world's biggest firm devoted exclusively to fund management and has 35 billion dlrs in funds he said Mitsui Investment Co Ltd established two years ago controls about 800 mln dlrs 80 pct of which is invested in Japanese equities cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said Japan will invest 24 billion yen in <PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium> in addition to the 683 billion yen already invested in the company The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment he said They will also provide equal shares in 63 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil in addition to the 457 billion yen already invested The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct the official said Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct but an agreement has yet to be reached industry sources said Under the rescue scheme for Asahan in which 911 billion yen has been invested Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 65 billion yen in Albras in which investment now totals 932 billion yen but its stake will not change from 51 pct the official said The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected reflecting Japan's desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand which totals some 18 mln tonnes a year they said and Co Ltd <MITST> paid 15 mln dlrs in early May for a five pct stake in <Zoran Corp> a California-based maker of large scale integrated circuits (LSI) with computer graphic communications and medical applications a Mitsui spokesman told He said the two firms will form a marketing company in Japan as early as next year although details of the joint venture are not yet fixed Mitsui expects last year's 10 billion yen Japanese LSI market to grow quickly Zoran was founded in 1981 and now has about 100 employees he said repairs and inadequate inspection caused the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines Co Ltd <JAPNT> (JAL) Boeing 747 which killed 520 people the Japanese government said in a final official report The clear cause of the crash was faulty repair work by the Boeing Co <BA> said Shun Takeda the ministry of transport official leading the accident investigation committee But the report also criticised the ministry's inspectors for failing to carry out a full check of the repairs before signing the clearance sheet The aircraft hit Mount Osutaka north of Tokyo on August 12 1985 after a bulkhead separating the pressurised cabin from the unpressurised tail suddenly burst fracturing key navigation systems Only four people survived A Japan Air Lines spokesman declined comment on the report Boeing is expected to release a statement later today The report cleared the JAL crew of all responsibility In a separate set of recommendations the investigators said large aircraft operating in Japan should have fail-safe systems but did not say how this should be done A press statement by a group of lawyers representing victims of the crash criticised the report for not dealing in greater depth with the fail-safe aspect The lawyers said Boeing had showed it believed the crash was due to design defects by specifying two design modifications to prevent a recurrence in a memorandum filed in King County Washington Superior Court last March 24 They said similar official recommendations for fail-safe systems following two air disasters involving DC-10 aircraft near Paris in 1974 and at Chicago in 1979 had been rejected after objections from aircraft manufacturers The government investigators asked the ministry to formulate concrete guidelines for its inspectors An internal ministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors were left too much on their own when making aircraft checks A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkhead under JAL supervision and Transport Ministry inspectors approved the repairs without actually seeing them today's report said The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work because the part repaired had been covered by a seal the report said Over time cabin pressurisation speeded up the process of metal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead Boeing issued an official statement on September 6 1985 saying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty It did not link them with the crash custom-cleared trade surplus narrowed to 161 billion dlrs in the first 10 days of June from 197 billion a year earlier the Finance Ministry said The June interim surplus compares with a 176 billion dlr surplus in the same May period FOB exports in the first 10 days of June rose 176 pct from a year earlier to 605 billion dlrs while CIF imports rose 396 pct to 444 billion The average yen/dollar rate used for the figures was 14104 yen against 16903 a year earlier

sector machinery orders excluding shipbuilding fell 104 pct in April from March to a seasonally adjusted 6638 billion yen after rising 176 pct in March the government's Economic Planning Agency said April orders rose 20 pct from a year earlier after a 226 pct year-on-year rise in March an agency spokesman told Seasonally adjusted private sector orders excluding those for shipbuilding and electric power firms fell 75 pct in April from March to 5174 billion yen after a 57 pct rise in March from February April orders fell 13 pct from a year earlier after being unchanged in March The April drop was due mainly to a 129 pct decrease in orders from machine tool industries and a 153 pct drop in orders from car makers the spokesman said US Officials are looking to Japan for help in buttressing the world economy in the event of an American recession next year Japanese government sources said During a visit to the US Earlier this month Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Advisers chairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the US Enters recession next year Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did not expect a recession next year Volcker seemed to acknowledge that an economic downturn was at least a possibility the sources said Faced with with a huge budget deficit the US Has little room to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturn that might occur in 1988 It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concerned because US Inflation is already showing some signs of picking up one source said But Japan is also limited in what action it could take to help counteract a US Recession without running the risk of overstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation the sources said Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates are at record low levels In May M-2 money supply plus certificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 102 pct well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct Some government sources are also worried that the recently announced 6000 billion yen emergency economic package could push up land prices and the construction sector's inflation Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of about 10 pct in April but that could accelerate to 20 pct later this year under the impact of the emergency package one source said The 6000 billion yen package was generally well received in the US Although US Congressmen and businessmen told Kondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly sources said The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of public works spending in the package was taking place immediately they said US Congressmen were particularly interested in how much impact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade imbalance a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly given the many economic uncertainties involved the sources said While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in terms of volume some Congressmen expressed concern that it was not falling fast enough But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further rise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade imbalance will lend 2717 billion yen to Indonesia and will share equally with the World Bank a 725 billion yen loan to Bolivia as part of its efforts to help Third World countries a Foreign Ministry spokesman said The lending is in line with Japan's plan to contribute 20 billion dlrs over the next three years to developing countries Both loans will be used for development the spokesman told He declined to name terms Itoh and Co Ltd <CITTT> said its group net profit in the year ending March 31 1988 is expected to be unchanged from a

simulation processor which took four years to develop will not be marketed he said chairman of the Life Insurers Association told a press conference that life insurance companies will increasingly diversify their investments away from US Bonds to protect themselves against currency swings an association spokesman said Terumichi Tsuchida said Japanese investment in US Bonds is decreasing but not drastically Life insurers are increasingly placing some of their funds in other currencies including bonds in Canadian dlrs and in European currencies he told the conference government should cut its consumer rice price if the official producer price is reduced next month Tetsuo Kondo director general of the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) told reporters Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due to the strong yen and lower oil prices Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice Price Council an advisory body to the ministry on July 1 and 2 The consumer rice price is usually set in December Co <BA> said in a statement it has yet to see the official Japanese government report on the crash of a Japan Air Lines (JAL) Boeing 747 in which 520 died However it said it had agreed with an earlier draft report that the accident was caused by incorrect repairs which remained undetected during scheduled inspections The final report released today said faulty repairs to the plane in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by Transport Ministry inspectors caused the 1985 crash the worst single air disaster in aviation history Boeing said it did not believe a similar accident could occur under any foreseeable operating conditions but said it had made tests and provided equipment for new planes and for planes already in service to ensure it could not happen again could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan the US And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies an advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed An EPA official told the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the US Failed to restructure their economies The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national product (GNP) in 1993 the report said It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993 If the two nations restructured their economies the dollar would remain stable in real terms while reducing Japan's current-account surplus to 21 pct of GNP in 1993 This scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 35 pct a year It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2000 if the adjustments were made must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs In the fiscal year ended March 31 the surplus totalled 9376 billion dlrs or about 45 pct of GNP The 6000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan's current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs he said Tokyo stock market will probably not make significant gains next week and may suffer a temporary correction brokers said Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 25 pct discount rate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firm against the yen in the near-term has created a measure of uncertainty over the market's future brokers said Everybody is just trying to think through things and see exactly what is going on said a broker at Sanyo Securities Co Ltd There is a lot of confusion he added This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stock prices over the last two days Today the 225-share average ended 46243 points lower at 2528812 People expect a correction next week They don't care if the market falls to 24000 the Sanyo broker said There is always enough money waiting to get into the market to fill any correction Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bull run to repeated cuts in the discount rate which diverts money from bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost of borrowing boosting domestic demand and imports Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfolios to sell domestic-related issues and include a few more exporters said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar is unlikely to fall sharply in the near term thus convincing stock market investors to buy electronics precision instrument machinery and some other export-oriented manufacturing shares brokers said Some people are awaiting the results of

billion yen in the year ending October 31 1987 up 12 pct from a year earlier assuming a yen/dollar rate of 147 yen in the second half a company spokesman told Sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 122 billion yen up 09 pct from a year earlier But net profit will fall 717 pct to three billion yen in 1986/87 from a year earlier when the company made a 1059 billion net profit due to sales of real estate assets worth seven billion yen the spokesman said The precision instrument maker will retain 13 yen dividend for 1986/87 the spokesman said It earlier reported parent company net profit of 134 billion yen in the six months ended April 30 down 855 pct from a year earlier on sales of 6092 billion down 01 pct The poor net was mainly due to a fall to 45 mln yen in extraordinary profit in the first half against 770 billion of such profit a year earlier due mainly to sales of assets The drop in first half sales was due to the yen's rise against the dollar which cut sales by some 430 billion yen The dollar averaged 157 yen against 192 a year earlier Motors Ltd <ISUMT> forecast a parent company net loss of 15 billion yen in the year ending October 31 1987 against a 398 billion loss a year earlier assuming a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen a spokesman said Sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 910 billion yen down 102 pct from a year earlier The automaker earlier reported a parent company net loss of 1292 billion in the six months ended April 30 1987 against a 165 billion yen profit a year earlier on sales of 44390 billion down 159 pct from a year earlier The poor first half performance was due to the yen's rise against the dollar which cut 8427 billion yen off sales the spokesman said The average yen/dollar rate rose to 158 yen in the first half from 207 a year earlier First half car exports fell to 68445 from 82093 a year earlier mainly due to drop in exports to the US While domestic sales rose to 30643 from 29836 Truck exports fell to 108782 from 127903 because a two-year contract to sell a total of 40000 trucks to China ended last year and domestic sales fell to 55925 from 61954 The company estimated sales at 207000 cars in 1986/87 down 52 pct from a year earlier and 339000 trucks down 98 pct the spokesman said He gave no estimate of exports commercial creditor banks confirmed an earlier commitment to extend some 360 mln dlrs in new loans to Argentina banking sources said The commitment will represent a part of the 195 billion dlrs in new loans to Argentina agreed to by 350 banks worldwide last April 24 the sources said The 350 banks were supposed to confirm their Argentina loan commitments by June 17 About 91 pct of them have already done so but it may take some more time before all have confirmed their intentions the sources added oil companies are starting campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel oil sources said Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer starting with <Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20 Showa Shell Sekiyu KK <SHOLT> introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product the sources said We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption Showa Shell said Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre 15 yen higher than regular gasoline and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan's high octane gasoline market it said High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total gasoline sales in Japan it added Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100 Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOLT> said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1 aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas an official at a major oil company said An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry including the lifting of gasoline production quotas to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers Nippon Oil Idemitsu and Showa Shell suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986 ended last March Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 25 pct from the previous year according to a MITI report crushers bought 8000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment from the last-half of July to September trade sources said Price details were not available group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress saying it would curb their exports slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt Mario Rodriguez Montero president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto Rodriguez said as yet the administration is not in a veto frame of mind Pentagon has stopped approving any new military contracts to Japan's Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> over a Toshiba subsidiary's transfer of submarine technology to the Soviet Union a senior defense official said We are not approving any new contracts (with Toshiba) pending a satisfactory resolution of this entire matter Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Stephen Bryen told confirming published reports on the matter The temporary ban which Bryen said has been in effect unofficially since April could cost Toshiba hundreds of mlns of dlrs in electronics business with the Pentagon including a pending 100 mln dlr Air Force deal for small computers Bryen said the US military services have not signed any contracts with Toshiba since April when publicity arose over subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co's alleged sale to Moscow of milling machines which will grind silent submarine propellers The Japanese government has been investigating the case and it was previously reported that Toshiba Machine sold four large milling machines to the Soviet Union in late 1983 or early 1984 But Bryen told in an interview that the Pentagon has now been informed by Japanese police that at least four more smaller machines capable of making such precision propellers were also sold to the Kremlin apparently in 1984 There may be even more beyond that I don't know yet Bryen said Toshiba is known to be seeking a US Air Force contract for 90000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs The Air Force has called for new bids on that contract partly because of the Toshiba investigation Pentagon officials said The officials who asked not to be identified said the computer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding because of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by US import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics Two days ago three US senators said they wanted a temporary ban on all US imports of Toshiba Corp products including television sets and videotape recorders Senators Jake Garn of Utah Richard Shelby of Alabama and John Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to a major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology transfer and Pentagon officials have told that some of the state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on Soviet attack submarines The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba Machine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one year The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was involved in the original technology transfer providing vital computer software to be used with the Japanese milling equipment But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen said that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more recent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment for Tokyo stocks are mixed this week with investors trying to figure out the future of the yen/dollar exchange rate and digest the implications of OPEC's latest accord on crude output and pricing brokers said They said the market should extend the dull trend it has been in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the record close at 2592942 on June 17 It ended at 2490272 on Saturday and fell further this morning to close at 2470768 in an uncertain reaction to the weaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper less well-known stocks in the exchange's first and second sections which were generally showing more resilience The second section index in contrast to the first closed at a record 240464 on June 26 surpassing the peak set on June 17 of 240171 Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic economy are a good bet said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd He said his observation was based on figures showing that business activity in Japan is booming The government said on Friday that department store and supermarket sales rose 75 pct in May from a year earlier while orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in the same month were up 76 pct year on year Brokers expected more such figures but said many stocks linked to domestic demand remain overpriced They are hard to find but companies with an attractive niche in the domestic economy unaffected by currency movements are the best bet said a broker at a foreign securities house who declined to be identified But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic consumption are stirring inflation fears The consumer price index rose 02 pct in May from April the third consecutive month on month increase Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation which erodes the real value of stock holdings they say rising prices arouse concern that interest rates may climb The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut in Japan's 25 pct discount rate Such assumptions have now died discouraging investors brokers said If oil prices rise the stock market in Japan could suffer a downturn as higher production costs stir inflation But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may also firm brokers said I have never been able to justify this because it should mean that the cost of importing rises said a broker at Yamaichi Securities Co It just always happens Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally if the dollar climbs against the yen But prices of many blue chip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks making them look less attractive brokers said However if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen the market index may rally brokers said A lower dollar could damp down rising capital outflows into dollar investments from Japan's stock and bond markets brokers said And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the balance of trade between the United States and Japan a lower dollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand for American imports by stimulating its local economy brokers said If the dollar falls buy domestic if it rises maybe buy a few exporters said one foreign broker has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 oil traders said They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 166 mln bpd from the 183 mln agreed in December There are light oversupplies now but OPEC  Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter and is in effect putting pressure on end-users a European crude oil trader said In Tokyo one oil analyst said There's no reason to expect a weak market from now on A Japanese oil trader also based in Tokyo said We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai a benchmark crude they expect price increases over the next few days August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 1735 dlrs above Friday's 1715-20 range but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 1742 Even prices of light Mideast grades such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes are expected to improve from recent weak positions 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least They said that after initial jumps they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and US Stockbuilding for winter they added There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high said an international trader in Tokyo Another Tokyo trader was less bullish For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat A Singapore trade source said There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota was a bearish factor to be considered Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies dealers said agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said will ratify the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) with effect from July 1 and will renew its membership in the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987 Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue the officials said Steel Ltd> said it has agreed to supply technology to manufacture thin-walled copper tubing used in air conditioners and refrigeration units to <Halstead Industries Inc> in Zelienople Pennsylvania Total demand for copper tubing in the US Is 25000 tonnes a month of which 5000 is for the thin-walled type Kobe said in a statement The two companies are studying joint partial production of Kobe's thin-walled copper tubing in the US Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy central bank officials said Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an announcement effect in which we would reassure the market of the fact that we have not changed our policy stance a senior central bank official told The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today the officials said The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices the officials said But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 408/00 pct while the bank's bid was 375 pct they said The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation they said The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further a bank manager said adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain If this is the case the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being he said Bank of Japan will tomorrow sell 1200 billion yen in bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 2100 billion money market traders said Of the total 800 billion yen will yield 36004 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in 34-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 3 The other 200 billion yen will yield 36003 pct in 43-day repurchase accords maturing on August 12 The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 36503 pct in 50-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 19 The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 35625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and 36250 pct on two-month bills They attributed the projected surplus mainly to 1900 billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments and public bodies Corp <SNET>

high-technology Japanese exports significantly damaged mutual security US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Weinberger told a press conference that exports of Japanese machines designed to make Soviet submarines quieter and harder to detect had been a serious blow But he said he was encouraged by the punishment dealt to Toshiba Machine Co a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> for the illegal exports and by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's assurances that action would be taken to keep it from happening again The government has barred Toshiba Machine from exporting to Communist countries for a year and said it intends to strengthen and expand its export control system Weinberger gave no details of the anti-submarine program In his talks with Japanese Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara he said he made a pitch for American companies seeking to build Japan's new fighter aircraft for the 1990's I assured Minister Kurihara that I support his plans to increase Japanese air defence capabilites and that I believe American aircraft can do this he said The Japanese industry argues it should develop the fighter plane on its own Motor Corp <MAZTT> has signed an agreement to import coal from <Coalex Pty Ltd> of Australia through Sumitomo Corp <SUMTT> a Mazda spokesman said Under the agreement Mazda will annually import 144000 tonnes of Australian coal worth about nine billion

but added that such contracts are usually for long periods Bank of Japan has become increasingly worried about a possible crash of high-flying financial markets Bank of Japan sources said We're afraid that someday the bubble will burst and that the deflationary impact on the economy will be very disastrous one source said They said the central bank has embarked on a delicate policy -- it wants to deflate the speculation that has pumped up prices sharply in recent months without bursting the bubble Stock prices plunged 39331 points today extending the sharp declines of earlier this month as the market speculated that interest rates would rise The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy central bank officials said Today's CD buying operation was designed to reassure the market the Bank has not changed its policy a senior central Bank official told There is a possibility that a deflationary impact would permeate the economy if the prices of existing assets collapsed the Bank of Japan said earlier this month in its annual economic report Such a possibility has been heightened by what the Bank sees as excessive speculation in stock bond and land prices Over the last two years the stock market average has doubled driving price/earnings ratios to over 70 compared with about 15 on Wall Street Bond yields have dropped sharply while land prices in Tokyo have soared The excessive speculation means the markets are increasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus more vulnerable one central bank source said A collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of what little confidence they have in the economy after the yen-induced recession of the past year private economists said Some hard-pressed exporters already make greater profits through financial dealings than from their basic businesses they said There seems to be an accelerated demand for money to support transactions in shares bonds land and other existing assets which has little bearing on value added and therefore on GNP the Bank of Japan said in its report The increased inclination of investors to seek capital gains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assets could have dangerous implications for the economy it added In the Bank's view a major reason behind skyrocketing prices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in the market that interest rates were heading inexorably lower Mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed by excessive liquidity the Central Bank's board recently decided it had to spell out clearly to the markets that a further discount rate cut was not in the offing one source said But the bank had to do that without tightening monetary policy and running the risk of a market collapse This was achieved partly by a rise in short-term interest rates which Bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and to a change in market expectations While denying the bank was tightening monetary policy a senior source welcomed the change in market expectations The source acknowledged the shift may have been caused partly by the decision to press commercial banks to limit lending in the July/September period Faster than expected economic growth and a strong dollar also played a part In the longer run the Central Bank is counting on a gradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from the financial markets into productive areas like capital spending one Bank of Japan economist said But while it waits for that to occur over the next six months it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetary policy that could collapse the market and lead to recession Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax revenues in 1986/87 government officials said Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to provide the revenue for more than 1000 billion yen of tax cuts promised in the government's emergency economic package last month But his argument has been undercut by reports that the 1986/87 tax take was as much as 2500 billion yen more than expected That means the government should have more than enough money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax measures proposed by Nakasone one official said The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising revenue to offset the tax cuts But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of an indirect tax at least for the time being He still hopes to gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on small savings The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed from increased receipts from land and securities taxes as prices of both shares and land soared one official said But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than expected perhaps indicating the recession of the last year induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought he said The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be released by the Finance Ministry on July 1 The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89 budget several officials said A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to stick with its so-called minus-ceiling policy which calls for government departments to reduce investment spending by five pct a year But he acknowledged this would be difficult given the sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy

yen in interest payments said an international agreement on loans to Poland was needed before Tokyo extended fresh loans to Warsaw to help a Japanese car maker set up a factory there Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone explained the conditions during the first round of talks with the visiting Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski foreign ministry sources said They quoted Jaruzelski as saying of a private Japanese plan to export car production facilities to Poland If this project goes well it will serve as an engine in future economic relations between Poland and Japan Nakasone speaking of the possibility of resuming extending official loans to Poland said It is necessary that an agreement should be established at an international arena such as the Paris Club of creditor nations He hoped that such an agreement will be achieved at an early date but he did not make firm commitments about Japanese loans the sources said Along with western nations Japan has witheld new official credits to Poland since February 1982 following the 1981 declaration of martial law in Poland The Japanese car maker Daihatsu Motor <DMOTT> and three trading houses including Mitsui Co Ltd plan to export production facilities to Poland's state-owned car maker FSO to make the Charade minicar according to Mitsui officials We are pushing the plan on the premise of an official credit to be extended eventually a Mitsui spokesman said Nakasone also said that a joint Japan-Poland economic committee would discuss the proposed conclusion of an investment protection agreement later this year the

five years in accordance with prevailing market rates Banks in the consortium are Bank of Tokyo International Ltd Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd The Long Term Credit Bank of Japan Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co Sumitomo Bank Ltd Mitsubishi Bank Ltd Sanwa Bank and Yashouda Bank and Trust Corp the Bank of Greece said firms are expected to enjoy the advantage of superior experience over their Japanese competitors in the new promising business of bringing asset rich Japanese investors to the US financial futures markets Japan allowed local financial institutions last month to start using overseas futures in currencies bonds and stocks to help them manage their bulging foreign portfolios US investment banks are going to take advantage We've been in the business for two decades the Japanese have not said Eugene Atkinson president of Goldman Sachs Japan Corp Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into the new markets but in fact participation so far has been slow Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said Koichi Kane Executive Vice President of Nomura Securities International said They're still in a starting up period They're testing the water Atkinson added But once they start the Japanese are likely to become very big players opening up lucrative business opportunities he said US investment banking sources said the slow start is understandable because US institutional investors too are fairly new to the market Futures markets have a long history in the US but because of the high risks involved American pension funds and mutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until relatively recently a US investment bank futures analyst said In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed for the slow start the Japanese sources said Japan is liberalizing its financial markets but domestic financial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers in Japan for overseas futures markets This may change next year when bankers speculate that securities houses will be permitted to enter this line of business While the Japanese are out of the business the Americans have moved in with First Boston Corp Salomon Brothers Inc Goldman Sachs and Co Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and PainWebber Inc leading the charge they said In the US Nikko Securities Co International Inc is preparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of Trade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for futures products Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said Nomura Japan's largest securities house has not yet decided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the US to establish closer links between Japanese investors and the US futures markets Kane said The evening session of CBT inaugurated recently to coincide with early Tokyo business hours has increased Japanese participation to some extent but the brokerage issue is still a hurdle the Japanese sources said High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures market so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime trading session in Chicago if possible they said The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and establishing channels to pay fees and margins but harmonizing clerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and Chicago are proving to be a burden the sources said Some Japanese banks which are largely barred from the securities industry in Japan have contemplated buying into the US brokerage business the Japanese sources said One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions which was also a spur for US commercial banks to get into the brokerage business they said The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or to go into a business tie-up said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd in New York One trust bank source said total fees could amount to around one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets fully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively many foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth capital assets but the futures brokerage business to be a different story Japanese banking sources said They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to difficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future some US brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13 dlrs per contract below the break-even level they said Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to approach Japanese financial institutions about possible tie-ups a futures indusry source in Chicago said But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small capital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese nervous about a capital link Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage business once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts growing fast and proves to be profitable they said But the big question they added is whether the Japanese government would let banks engage in this new risky business subsidiary of (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co Ltd) and privately-held (Murex Corp) jointly announced they signed an agreement giving Kyowa exclusive rights in Japan to market certain Murex products to detect AIDS The companies estimated that Japanese clinicians will perform a minimum of 28 mln AIDS tests a year The Murex products must be approved by Japanese authorities before they are sold in Japan seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 32 pct in May the worst level since the government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953 the government's Management and Coodination Agency said The May rate surpassed the previous record of 30 pct marked set in January and April this year It was also up sharply from 27 pct a year earlier Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 191 mln people up from 190 mln in April and 162 mln a year earlier An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the strong yen for the rise in unemployment The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose to a record 32 pct surpassing the previous record 30 pct set in July 1986 This compares with 29 pct in April and 27 pct a year earlie Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 112 mln up 180000 from a year earlier The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from April at a record 31 pct A year ago the rate was 28 pct Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100000 to 790000 The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell 210000 or 15 pct from a year earlier to 1410 mln Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to meet for talks The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock market There is no special worry about the stock market in Tokyo he added Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan and stability of exchange rates Asked if the US Had contacted Japan after the stock market plunge in New York Miyazawa said there was not any contact Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker on Sunday that some nations were not abiding by the spirit of the Louvre Accord were just aimed at reaffirming that agreement The agreement to cooperate in stabilising currencies was reached in Paris in February this year The finance minister made the remark at a news conference which followed a morning cabinet meeting said it understood why the US Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday Japan deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the ships navigating in the Gulf understands the circumstances that have led the United States government to take these measures the Foreign Ministry said in a statement The statement added that the threat to free and safe navigation had increased after the missile attack on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday Inc

steeply which did not happen yesterday Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from US Shares said Akira Kawakami deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department An unstable lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in US Bonds Japan-US Interest rate differentials which currently look wide enough mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability said Kawakami US Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major US Institutional and individual investors he said The effect should be to rule out any US Interest rate rise But most Japanese investors in US Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable he said The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday most are still looking for chances to lighten their US Stock inventories Hiromitsu Sunada manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1738 the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914 Investment in US Stocks and bonds is difficult considering the dangers said Katsuhiko Okiyama deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street the managers said The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks which is what investors have been waiting for The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 63 pct yield for the 51 pct 89th bond they said The basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has not changed said Norio Okutsu assistant general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department But new outflows of funds to the US Will be decreasing However this was already evident three months ago he said Corp <NIPNT> will supply <Matra-Harris Semiconducteurs SA(A)> (MHS) of France with manufacturing technology for 16-bit microchips used in microcomputers an NEC spokesman said MHS a joint venture between France's MATRA <MATRPA> and Harris Corp <HRS> of the US Will manufacture and market globally a microcomputer based on NEC's Micron PD 78312 and Micron PD78310 chips MHS will pay NEC an undisclosed sum for the technology Finance Ministry will take a wait-and-see stance on Tokyo Stock Exchange movement although it is gravely concerned about the sharp fall in stock prices a senior Ministry official said The official who declined to be identified told reporters the 73 pct drop in Tokyo stock prices this morning was caused primarily by psychological factors following the 225 pct fall in New York stock prices overnight He said the Ministry is in close contact with the Tokyo Stock Exchange but has no plans yet to take any specific measures regarding the fall Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation We must watch things a little longer New York is down 22 pct London 10 pct while compared to this Japan is seven pct down Kyodo quoted him as telling reporters Asked if he agreed with analysts who called the stock sell-off Black Monday Nakasone said: Compared with times past economics have changed completely He rejected a comparison between the present situation and the stock market collapse of 1929 and the recession which followed of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he welcomed Monday's US And West German joint confirmation of their commitment to the Louvre accord Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were excessively concerned about the economic future The Bank of Japan will continue to adhere to a system of policy coordination based upon the Louvre accord of February he said The accord called for stability in foreign exchange rates Exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady recovery he said Stock Exchange president Michio Takeuchi said the exchange has no immediate plans to suspend trading to cool off panic stock selling However he said Tokyo may consider such a measure if the London and New York exchanges are closed overnight I don't think it will happen he added He also told reporters the exchange will relax margin requirements effective on Wednesday to encourage stock buying Takeuchi said the sharp fall in stock prices was mostly due to psychological factors We need to keep close watch on market movement but we expect the market will stabilise soon he said adding that individual investors should remain calm It is advisable to wait for an autonomous recovery of the market he said The margin requirement in cash will be reduced to 50 pct from 70 pct while the margin collateral requirement in equity will rise to 70 pct from 60 pct effective on Wednesday he said Takeuchi also said the exchange has no specific plan to take coordinated action with the New York and London exchanges to help stabilise stock prices The drop on Wall Street was caused by various factors but was primarily the result of a correction of overvalued share prices he said The current stock price plunge cannot compare with the Great Depression as the economic environment is very different he added The exchange has not changed plans to introduce stock futures trading next year despite press reports that the Wall Street fall was linked with futures trading he said Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> said it has started to market a remodelled version of its four wheel drive (4WD) Safari vehicle in Japan Nissan said in a statement it hopes to sell 250 vehicles a month in Japan It also plans soon to start exporting 3400 vehicles a month to the Australian Middle East and Asian markets under the name Patrol a spokesman said It will sell the vehicle in Europe sometime in the future with shipments from <Motor Iberica SA> its Spanish unit The volume for Europe will be set later Finance Ministry plans to examine how life insurance companies realised capital gains through transactions undertaken in June just before the yen bond market began to fall sharply a senior Ministry official said The move is aimed at cooling fierce competition in the field and will pave the way for a Ministry system to check that insurers do not inflate investment returns on the accounts to attract investors he said Some insurers transfer part of their unrealised gains from general accounts to the variable life accounts violating their internal regulations industry sources said The eight major local life-insurers which offer variable life policies here realised an average return of 2101 pct on such policies in the year ended September The Ministry will scrutinise the policies of 17 local and foreign life insurers which offer the variable life schemes Japan has 23 major local life insurers none of which is listed on the stock market in Japan's M-2 plus certificates of deposit (CD) money supply in the October to December period is not expected to accelerate but will remain at high levels between 11 and 12 pct a senior Bank of Japan official said The central bank will keep a watch on high growth in liquidity because this is a factor that may cause rises in prices of goods he said The September growth of 111 pct year on year announced earlier today should not be taken as implying that the money supply has started to expand very rapidly he said In August the rate of increase was 110 pct economists fear a world recession if stock exchanges continue to plunge Others are more sanguine The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying personal assets and dampening consumption The real economic effects can be significant -- the destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy said an economist at a US Securities house But other economists said such fears were overblown Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal assets that much negative impact could be observed (in the US) said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing such a major role in the entire US Gross national product (GNP) Honda said The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on Monday was sparked by fears the US Economy is heading for a recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assets is less than in the US And the total weight of individuals' holdings in the stock market is less so there will be less damage than in the US said an economist at one of Japan's major brokerage houses Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic demand so while there could be some impact from the reduction of assets value it would not be a major impact said the Bank of Tokyo's Honda Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in US Interest rates as a positive sign for the US Economy US Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling that interest rates have hit their ceiling and the US Economy is strong so there should be no direct impact from the collapse of share prices said Toshiaki Kakimoto Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Some economists suggested that should markets continue to slump the major industrial nations may have to discuss possible joint lowering of official discount rates Until last week a discussion of lower rates was unthinkable now it's not said the Japanese brokerage house economist There has been a move from the purely rational to the emotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare said the foreign economist It will require strong global leadership by politicians to snuff out he said However previously the stocks correction was due to fears of higher interest rates a possible resurgence of inflation and the depreciation of the dollar said Nobuyuki Ueda senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of the US Economy Ueda said If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future movement of the economy this decline will have very significant implications for the US Economy he said If the low levels hold those who were keeping consumption high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier If the paper gains aren't there people won't spend A US Recession could then trigger similar declines in other economies some economists said I don't know if a possible recession in the US Would trigger a world recession because other nations such as Japan are showing good economic performance LTCB's Ueda said But we can't rule out the possibility because the US Is still playing a very dominant role in the world economy and monetary authorities today staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to their ability to succeed The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses) and the Finance Ministry is limited said Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Peter Morgan Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ministry officials said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market collapse and subsequent recession Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic recovery and exchange rate stability Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm the panic saying in a statement that world stock markets were excessively concerned about the economic future Traditionally the four big houses -- Nomura Securities Co Ltd Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd Daiwa Securities Co Ltd and Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because of their sheer size and overwhelming market share This strength has in the past made it possible for the brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance Ministry analysts said But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages which have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets over the past year would have the strength this time to turn things around The question is are the Japanese brokerages strong enough to force investors to buy said Johsen Takahashi research director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in the bond markets and in their US Investments it is debatable whether they they could support buying he said We can support things to some extent but we can't completely suppress selling said one Japanese broker Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held by financial institutions and other corporations could have a stabilising effect on the market Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders said Keikichi Honda general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's economic research division This is a tightly woven textile In its own way it is stronger than Wall Street But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument If a high percent of shares is cross held everything happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson Selling will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no liquidity You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market -- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers said Barclay's Morgan Shares held by what are termed stable shareholders or banks and other companies with which a firm does business might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets bad enough some analsyst said Closely held shares could become unclosely held said Morgan But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now because companies with their improved earnings prospects do not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons Japanese economy is firmly on the recovery path supported by robust domestic demand the Bank of Japan said in a regular monthly report The report said industrial production is strengthening as manufacturing companies have almost completed adjustments of their plant and equipment investment while non-manufacturing firms have continued to be positive in their capital spending Strong domestic demand such as consumer spending and housing investment will more than offset declining exports the central bank report said It also noted the continued rise in domestic wholesale prices and money supply Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 25 pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase A senior government economist suggested that both the US And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices They need to support the stock and security markets he said But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago With the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said There will be some impact on the real economy but it won't be that big said another Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said Paradoxically it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said That will at least take a couple of days if not weeks he said and West on Monday decided to go ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Representatives of the US The Soviet Union the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants but by joining them Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich West Germany and is scheduled for completion by 1990 an IAEA statement said Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries Dieter Sigmar a leading US Fusion researcher said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste While today's nuclear power plants need uranium mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water according to experts Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister will face a tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of his two-year term economists and businessmen said Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone However leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision and policies Takashi Ishihara chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development said in a statement Economists generally agreed that there will be no major changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader However expectations are high among major industries for new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with the US Administrative and tax reforms and soaring land prices Eishiro Saito chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) urged Takeshita to succeed in unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as possible to tackle difficult tasks Regarding foreign economic polices Yoshitoki Chino chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association said Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before economic issues develop into problems Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are doubts about his capability in handling international issues due to his lack of experience in diplomacy economists said Economists said foreign countries should be patient with Takeshita who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician Takeshita has repeatedly said There should be consensus before taking action Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus economists said He has said Japan will continue to stimulate the economy and to open the market wider to foreign products massive plunge in Tokyo stock prices on Tuesday could rob the Government of much-needed revenue to spur Japan's economy and may hurt banks' ability to lend abroad analysts polled by said The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp <NCCTT>) shares for much of its public spending budget said Shigeo Suzuki a deputy general manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan Japan had hoped to raise at least 5000 billion yen from the sale of 195 mln NTT shares on November 10 However the 149 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index today has made such plans look unrealistic analysts said The government could defer the sale of NTT or they could offer fewer shares said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd Honda said another possibility is that the underwriters handling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government the amount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any losses themselves That is what underwriting means he added A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the government planned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10 Another possible effect of Tokyo's stock tumble would be to seriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks The banks lend money all over the world and regard the market value of stock holdings as assets analysts said Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70 pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings as assets said Industrial Bank's Suzuki There is also concern that Japanese companies which have invested heavily in Tokyo's stocks as their real business declined over the last two years have sustained heavy losses Many companies mainly export-oriented companies were planning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest in real businesses as the economy begins to pick up said one analyst at a foreign brokerage That prospect now looks dim But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financial institutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading I don't think any company is so badly exposed in stock investments said a senior analyst at Nomura Research Institute In terms of financial institutions luckily the rebounding bond market and currency markets are still profitable he added The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stocks would be translated into a fall of about 02 pct in consumer spending Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 329588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386041 billion at Monday's close NTT shares ended 260000 yen lower at 265 mln each well down from their peak of 318 mln in April 100 mln dlr equity warrant bond for Intec Inc <INTTT> of Japan has been cancelled because of turbulent market activity following today's 149 pct plunge in Tokyo stock prices Nikko Securities Co (Europe) Ltd said as lead manager The five year issue on launched October 13 had terms fixed yesterday when it last traded at a bid only price of less 2-1/4 pct placing it on total fees Nikko officials said Indeed dealers said stock price volatility shut down trading altogether in Japanese equity related debt issues today and cast doubt on the new issue calendar for the next few weeks during which as many as eight new deals were to be launched Finance Minister Michael Wilson says the leading industrial nations have held a number of discussions on providing liquidity to the financial system after Monday's record stock market decline There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada the United States Japan Britain West Germany France and Italy) he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer interest rates have been dropping Wilson said The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries Wilson said This has been going on during the course of yesterday through the evening and this morning and this will continue he said What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economieslooks good Wilson said Irish Banks Plc <ALBKL> said it plans to open a Tokyo office Initially it will be a representative office but the company said it hopes to have a full banking licence in about two years Secretary Richard Lyng said the ruling of a GATT panel on a US trade complaint against Japan expected soon may influence the US stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a US demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the US These are quota items and the principles that apply to them it seems to me will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus Lyng told in an interview He repeated the US demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31 next year The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste some cheeses and specialty fruit juices US officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman The US has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus) If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT Lyng said He declined to say what action the US would take next April if Japan continues to resist US demands European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said Inc said it was selected to perform fact-finding security system surveys for the authority that is building Kansai International Airport in Osaka Japan The company said the 340000 dlr contract was significant because it was the first contract issued by the authority solely to an American company without Japanese partners The contract calls for TRW to perform studies of other international airport security systems on behalf of Kansai the company said Kansai is scheduled to be operational in 1993 collapse in US stock prices has hit Japanese investors hard since they had shifted to stocks from bonds earlier this year and will slow down Japanese capital flows to the US investors and stock brokers said Until recently Japanese net purchases of US stocks were projected to leap to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year from four billion dlrs in 1986 securities industry sources said The Japanese had suffered severely from US bond investments and now (they are suffering) in US stocks said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd Japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in Treasury securities until early this year which led to heavy currency losses following the dollar's steep decline Even though their US bond purchases moderated since then Japanese investors continued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply in recent months Now the historic fall in the US stock market has stunned Japanese investors killing their appetite for US stocks Keita Konishi of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co said while his firm was not panicked into an across-the-board sell-off of its US stock investments he does not expect it to resume buying stocks for some time There has been no panic selling by Japanese institutional investors so far during the stock price nosedive said Susumu Uchiyama of Yamaichi Internatinal (America) Inc Following the steep decline however Japanese are not buying even though US stocks now appear bargain-priced he said There will be no big wave of Japanese investment in the US for the time being said Keiji Tsuda of Nissei BOT Asset Management Corp an investment advisory body to Nippon Life Insurance Co It's the time to think twice The psychological impact (on investors' behaviour) will drag on considerably he said The latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered by US Treasury Secretary James Baker as he threatened a futher dollar fall in retaliation for higher West German interest rate rises and undermined foreign investors' confidence in the dollar Tsuda said The US economy is still sitting on the time bomb of huge budget and trade deficits he said and investors' worries over the twin problems have intensified Before I thought the dollar's large fall (over the past two years) would take out the detonator out of that bomb but it hasn't Tsuda said Investors and brokers said the Japanese for the first time have experienced the enormous volatality of the New York stock market often caused by program trading A stock trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc said that while Japanese investors had been attracted by American firms' superior performance relative to Japanese firms in terms of earnings per share US stocks' downside potential is now much larger than that oJapanese stocks While the Japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive it could be stabilized by the efforts of large Japanse firms A high percentage of Japanese equities are held by companies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks of other Japanese firms in order to strengthen their business ties through this cross-holding relationship analysts said Despite the massacare on the Wall Street Japanese investors are not expected to withdraw from US stocks US equities are in a process to be built in diversification of their portfolios and the portion of them is still very small Japanese investors said But it is unclear when the Japanese will resume purchasing US stocks and much depends on the dollar's stability they said Kondo of Yasuda Trust said Japanese investors are not fully convinced that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is determined to fend the dollar's value and check future inflation in the US Because of uncertainty over the dollar's direction and inflation in the US Japanese investors have not yet jumped on the Treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yield rises investors said Konishi of Sumitomo Life said A US recession is being talked about so it may be time to shift back to bonds but I feel uneasy about buying any US instruments right now Tsuda of Nissei questioned the strength of the recent rally in US government bond prices He said the steep bond market rally has no real trend as bond prices are rising on short covering and bills are rising on temporary fund shift from the stock market United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month Reagan Administration officials said President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the US and third country markets and to open its home market to US goods The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets hand-held power tools and portable computers Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the US market at below production costs Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to US goods US and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force the officials said until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement Reagan said the United States remains committed to the Louvre accord in which the seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency exchange rates The United States remains committed to the Louvre agreement Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers Reagan said the United States Japan and West Germany had all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic policies Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic relations with the United States Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre agreement They reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable exchange rates Reagan said Communications Co said it signed an agreement with CST Communications Co for the purpose of financing American motion picture projects CST is an American corporation formed by C Itoh and Co Ltd <CITTT> Suntory Ltd and Tokyo Broadcasting Systems Inc <TBRST> The company did not detail the agreement Bank of Japan bought around 50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds in an operation seen aimed at allaying fears of a collapse in the market bond traders said The central bank bought the 68 pct 73rd 65 pct 80th and 51 pct 89th issues Yield on the key 89th bond due 1996 subsequently fell to 5560 pct in early trading from 5920 pct at the close on Tuesday after opening at 5600 pct The market had generally welcomed the operation and trading volume had been gradually increasing There was some retail bargain-hunting for less active issues traders said Bank of Japan reassured a nervous money market after the sharp fall in Tokyo stock prices yesterday by conducting a 200 billion yen commercial bill purchase operation money traders said The central bank injected funds through three-month repurchase agreements which mature on January 11 and bear interest of 39375 pct identical to this morning's rates on three-month commercial bills The operation was done partly to roll over 300 billion yen in commercial bills maturing this morning Money market sources project a 260 billion yen surplus today In the bond market the Bank of Japan offered to buy around 50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds encouraging an already firm tone in bond prices dealers said The Bank of Japan was trying to reassure market participants that it was ready to supply funds whenever the market needed them especially after Tuesday's plunge in Tokyo stock prices securities house traders said The widely held market belief that interest rates were heading higher was a major cause of the recent tumble in bond market prices and one reason behind the stock market plunge they said market analysts polled before Tokyo's market opened on Tuesday said Wall Street's dramatic fall on Monday was overdone and although Tokyo would fall drastically at the opening it might stabilise later Factors affecting the Tokyo market are not the same as those in New York they said Tokyo's market is completely different from New York said a senior analyst at Nomura Securities We have no computer (program) selling and much more stable share ownership than in New York The discount rate in Japan cannot rise the senior Nomura analyst said He said the Tokyo Exchange's 225-share index may fall 1000 points on Tuesday because of basic concern It dropped 62018 points to 2574656 on Monday But he said a 1000 point fall would be nothing compared to New York New York overreacted the dollar is rising -- that should be a positive sign for New York he said The Tokyo Stock Exchange opens from 0900 local time (0000 GMT) to 1500 local (0600 GMT) The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points (or 225 pct) to 1738 on Monday its biggest ever one day decline in both absolute and percentage terms Simon Smithson a Kleinwort Benson International share analyst said Tokyo's market was likely to free fall in morning trading but perhaps would stabilise later He too predicted a drop of perhaps 1000 points in the index today But he said overall economic conditions in the US And Japan were different The problems that pushed down the New York market like the (US) budget deficit trade deficit and slow economic growth do not exist in Japan Smithson said However a stocks fund manager at a major trust bank made a more gloomy prediction The situation is different in the two markets but you cannot ignore New York he said Foreigners will be selling and the index funds will be selling he said A fund manager at another Japanese trust bank said Monday's New York fall was completely out of the range of expectations All we can do is wait now and see what happens There seem to be no factors which would stop the fall There is no way we can invest now he said Manhattan Corp (CMB) president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic conditions If we are right about the fundamentals this thing should settle down Labrecque said at a news conference at the American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause US monetary officials to ease credit policies Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year Labrecque said He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to continue well into 1988 I don't think the stock market will cause a recession Labrecque said He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from the stock market fall would be Chase's stock price however dropped 23 pct but other money center banks suffered even sharper losses Referring to the banking industry he said: We're talking about one day These are strong institutions he said Labrecque said he did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary policy in view of the stock market's behavior If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the other way he said Labrecque said the high US budget deficit was not the single most important factor behind the market's worries He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the United States West Germany Japan and Britain Japanese investment in US real estate will continue despite a weak dollar because such investments are strong hedges against inflation financiers and real estate industry experts said Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in US real estate Setsuya Tabuchi chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investing in Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered in the past during the dollar's sharp decline But he added Real estate is a hedge against inflation so such investment will not decline Japanese total investment in US real estate last year is estimated at around six billion dlrs exceeding the four billion dlrs ploughed into US equities Arther Mitchell of Coudert Brothers a US law firm told the conference Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanese banks and leasing companies the total aamount of Japanese funds committed to US real estate projects could reach 20 billion dlrs in 1987 he said The dollar's fall has made US property cheap and exchange risks are low because many Japanese firms are making investments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130 he said Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now looking at a wider variety of real estate investments including development projects and suburban buildings Benjamin Lambert chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc said the sale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designed to expand its customer base to Japan through the securities house's close ties with Japanese investors Participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular among Japanese panelists said Mortgages can be made to disguise active purchases and years later the loans can be converted into ownership of the property they said Control Systems Inc said it entered into a marketing agreement with a Japanese firm to distribute Cardiac's pacemakers in Japan Cardiac said the agreement requires the Japanese firm to purchase certain minimum quantities of pacemakers annually over the next three years with the aggregate value of purchases of about 12 mln dlrs Cardiac said it received an initial order from the Japanese company which is did not name for about 22 mln dlrs and expects to begin shipments during its fourth quarter to end March 31 1988 massive stock market correction on Wall Street will force a decline in Japanese share prices but a decline of similar proportions will not occur due to economic factors said Setsuya Tabuchi chairman of the board of Nomura Securities Co Ltd There are less inflation worries in Japan and less possibility of interest rate rises Tabuchi told reporters He also said Japan had a higher savings rate which provided more funds for investment than was the case in other countries If interest rates rise worldwide Japan may raise the discount rate but the possibility of a Japanese rate increase is smaller than in the US Britain and West Germany Tabuchi said However he noted that the Nikkei Dow stock index of the Tokyo stock exchange and the Dow Jones Industrial average have moved in tandem in the past four years The Dow fell 508 points to 1738 on Monday its largest percentage decline since the First World War The Tokyo index fell 62018 to 2574656 on Monday the sixth largest decline on record ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesdayhose former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita to be the next prime minister replacing Yasuhiro Nakasone whose term ends on October 30 LDP officials told the choice was made by Nakasone after Takeshita and two other contenders failed in marathon closed-door meetings to agree who should be Japan's next leader They were vying for the presidency of the LDP a post which automatically carries with it the premiership by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority Louvre accord on currency stability which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil foreign exchange dealers said But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive US Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan who both have large trade surpluses pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the US While the US Agreed to stop talking the dollar down However Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative the West German interest rate move would force the US To re-examine the accord The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany  He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation Chris Johns currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view telling that the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur who hosted the Louvre meeting was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks He called for a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord In Frankfurt F Wilhelm Christians joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank said that following recent meetings with Baker he believed that the US Was still committed to the accord In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 380 pct on Monday down from the 385 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct Fine Art Corp said it completed an exclusive license agreement with the Seiyoken Group of Toyko to open Circle Galleries in Japan The first Circle Gallery is to open in Tokyo in ealry 1988 with additional Circle Galleries planned the company said The license agreement is Circle Fine Art's second expansion outside the US this year Earlier this year it formed a joint venture company in Canada Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said Japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG the sources said They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan the sources said Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions traders said They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 21 pct a year from 1986 through 1991 Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987 when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase the sources said The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 195 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987 the sources said But when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market they said Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year of which 53 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia 33 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer the sources said The Japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 1752 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January the trade sources said Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement Under the present contract Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said When we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one Motor Corp <TOYOT> and Volkswagen AG <VOWGF> are considering raising the local procurement rate at their West German joint venture to at least 60 pct from an earlier planned 50 pct after one year's output a Toyota spokesman said The two carmakers agreed last June to start jointly producing a Toyota-designed light truck at VW's Hanover plant from early 1989 at a rate of 7000 to 8000 the first year rising to 15000 from 1990 They may equip the light truck with a Volkswagen-made engine to reach a local procurement rate of 60 pct he said The two companies need to raise the value of locally procured parts to 60 pct to avoid tariffs when they export to other European markets industry sources said Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in bills from its holdings on Tuesday to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 470 billion yen and recycle 400 billion in bills maturing then money market traders said Of the total 400 billion yen will yield 38512 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses through 29-day repurchase agreements maturing on November 17 These are aimed at meeting a projected cash shortage on that day when the government floats 195 mln shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp The other 400 billion will yield 39006 pct through 44-day repurchase accords maturing on December 2 The operation will bring the supply of bills outstanding to about 3200 billion yen clear indication has emerged of the victor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone but political analysts said it was becoming more likely that former foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen A decision on which of the three contenders would be picked was expected late today or early on Tuesday they said Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-door meetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone who is due to step down late this month to mediate to break the deadlock The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita They are vying for the post of president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who is automatically prime minister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority The new LDP president will be named formally at a party convention on October 30 and elected prime minister by parliament probably on November 6 LDP sources said Nakasone 69 is due to retire on October 31 after five years in the post an exceptionally long term by Japanese standards Takeshita who is head of the party's largest faction had steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help but he told reporters: It is possible Nakasone will be given carte blanche (for selection of his successor) One political analyst who declined to be identified said Nakasone despite a personal preference for Miyazawa is likely to choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan through its international problems and maintaining party unity Abe also would also accept Nakasone's influence he said Analysts said one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power as possible following his retirement Takeshita the early favorite because of the size of his faction is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack of international experience The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely to support Takeshita's bid because of the differences in their political styles Corp <TDKT> said its sales

Shinpan reached a similar agreement with <Visa International> on September 29 Ministry of Finance has started to consider the coupon rate of the 10-year government bond issue for November a Ministry official said The underwriting syndicate may want a rise in the coupon rate by nearly one point from the current 49 pct he said But bond traders see a rise to about 56 pct as most likely Ministry officials will try to keep the rate low to meet US Requests for maintenance of the interest rate differential between the US And Japan the Ministry official told Plans for an October issue were cancelled when the Ministry and the bond underwriting syndicate failed to reach agreement on terms The underwriting syndicate will start negotiating with the Finance Ministry on the terms of the November issue after any changes in the prime rate for November are decided which should be by the end of this week an underwriting source said Cancellation of the November bond issue is not out of the question he said adding that negotiations are expected to be difficult foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the US Dollar will drop below the significant 14000 yen level dealers said The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range If the currency breaks through this level it may decline sharply said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division The dollar was at 14110 yen at midday against Friday closes of 14235/45 in New York and 14135 here The dollar opened at 14095 yen and fell to a low of 14040 It was 17733/38 marks against 17975/85 in New York and 18008/13 here on Friday after an opening 17700/10 The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by US Treasury Secretary James Baker dealers said The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker's comments said Dai-ichi's Tanaka He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in US Bond prices dealers said Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge US Trade deficit Tanaka said US August trade data showed the US Deficit at a still massive 1568 billion dlrs But if West Germany raises interest rates this would run counter to the pledge he said Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention said Soichi Hirabayashi deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange department The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 14000 to 16000 yen dealers said The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively Hirabayashi said He said the US Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum three pct from 45 pct on October 25 It said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes to non-Iraqi Arab ports would be reduced to 30 pct from 45 A conference spokesman declined to say why the move was taken at a time of heightened tension in the Gulf Japan has pledged to try to increase its purchase of US car parts and also to exchange data to monitor the purchases the Commerce Department said US negotiators opened talks last August with Japanese officials to try to force open the Japanese market to American-made parts in an effort to redress an estimated five billion dlr deficit in car parts trade Japan had agreed to try to increase purchases of US-made parts by Japanese car makers and to begin long term contracts for parts purchases a Commerce department official said He added that the agreement also said Japan agreed to try to devise a way to collect purchasing information in order to monitor progress in stepping up Japanese orders The Commerce Department said in a statement last year that statistics support the perception in the United States that American auto parts suppliers are not welcome in the inner circles of Japan's auto companies and their traditional suppliers It estimated that while Japan's car firms sold almost five billion dlrs worth of parts in the United States in 1985 US firms sold only one per cent of Japan's 55 billion dlr market unadjusted consumer price index (base 1985) fell 04 pct to 997 in January from the previous month the government's Management and Coodination Agency said The fall compares with a decline of 02 pct in December The January index compared with a year earlier was down 11 pct the first drop larger than 10 pct since it fell 13 pct in September 1958 Food costs rose in January from December but prices fell for clothing footwear and utilities causing the overall decline for the month Housing medical and educations costs increased in January compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities gasoline and vegetables fell The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) was down 01 pct in mid-February from a month earlier at 1002 reflecting lower prices for food clothing and footwear Compared with a year earlier the index was down 07 pct due to lower vegetable fuel oil and utility costs Finance Ministry has proposed informally to its bond underwriting syndicate that the coupon on the January 10-year government bond remain unchanged from February at five pct underwriting sources said They said the ministry wants a 050 yen raise in issue price from February to 9950 to yield a record low 5075 pct The 5151 pct February bond issue yield was itself a record low The proposed issue volume is 475 billion yen against the 600 billion in February The underwriting syndicate is likely to accept the proposed terms

Britain France and Hong Kong fund managers said After concentrating on US Treasury bonds for years Japanese institutions now see a risk in relying too much on similar types of investments they said Japan's net buying in overseas stockmarkets this year may double or triple to 15-20 billion dlrs from seven billion in 1986 Shigeki Matsumoto of Nikko Securities Co Ltd said Matsumoto who manages Nikko's investment research and strategy said there is evidence Japanese investors began poking around in foreign stockmarkets around July last year but few made firm commitments until December when net purchases suddenly grew to 15 billion dlrs from around 500 mln in each of the previous five months Net buying in 1985 totalled only 995 mln dlrs he added This sudden penchent for overseas stocks is likely to draw the widest smiles from Wall Street because about 70 to 80 pct of funds will be invested in the US Markets Matsumoto said The trend has been to head toward the US Market first because of its size and next because it has been successful over the last couple of years said Eugene Atkinson managing director of Goldman Sachs International Corp Wall Street's massive turnover offers good liquidity enabling institutions to easily move large volumes of money in and out of shares with the minimum of risk he added However few see holdings in US Treasuries dwindling They will remain a Japanese mainstay fund managers said Institutions particularly life insurance companies which concentrate on income rather than capital gains to cover payouts to policy holders are unlikely to sell their US Treasuries but will put in less money said Shinichi Kobuse manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's international fixed income activities There has been some selling of US Bonds by short-term investors but the selling is unlikely to amount to a significant chunk of Japanese bond holdings because the liquidity of the US Bond market remains attractive he added Kobuse said investment managers are bullish on the US Equity markets despite predictions by economists the US Economy will remain sluggish over the next couple of months Interest in Wall Street has been spurred by recent reports of significant growth in earnings by major US Corporations he added Yutaka Hashimoto general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co told an economic conference that insurance companies which are responsible for 26 pct of Japanese funds in foreign securities hold a lopsided proportion of US Treasuries and intend to diversify into other instruments and currencies Insurance companies have put the dominant portion of their funds into the US But will now invest in Britain West Germany France and other countries Hashimoto said Lower interest rates worldwide make the returns on stocks relatively high in comparison with bonds and in light of the strength in the yen the growth in stock values is expected to offset currency risks he added One trust bank official said his bank aims for a 10 pct annual return on overseas investments but the recent decline in US 30-year bond yields has caused a rethink in pension fund investment stategies The bank is looking more at US Equities and European bonds he said Japanese investments in British equities have already turned active and the pace is likely to increase said Andrew Sheaf general manager of international equity activities at County Securities Japan Last week was the busiest week we had he said Investments are being spurred by the growth in profits of British companies and the recent deregulation of government controlled firms fund managers said Deregulation in France is also attracting Japanese interest but stock investments there will be inhibited by worries about the French franc they said Investments in Hong Kong will be mostly short-term and speculative due to uncertainty about the colony's long-term political stability they added Japanese investors are cautious about West Germany particularly as German firms like their Japanese counterparts are concerned about the recent dollar fall Australia also poses some risks due to currency values they added is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 55 pct from 62 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris Finance Ministry sources said They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law which should be approved by parliament on March 3 abolishing the 605 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses they said The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates the sources said However it was impossible for them to follow the last cut to 58 pct from 62 pct on January 28 because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 605 pct The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy they said On Tuesday the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 55 pct effective February 28 The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare the sources said These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate the ministry sources said Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds minus 01 percentage points is the likeliest choice they added ruling and opposition parties agreed to reopen talks on the budget for the fiscal year ending March 31 1988 when the Lower House Budget Committee meets next Tuesday a parliamentary official said He said officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition parties agreed at a meeting of the committee's board of directors Strong opposition objection to government tax reform proposals including a controversial sales tax has delayed deliberation by the Lower House Budget Committee Tokyo Grain Exchange said it will raise the margin requirement on the spot and nearby month for US And Chinese soybeans and red beans effective March 2 Spot April US Soybean contracts will increase to 90000 yen per 15 tonne lot from 70000 now Other months will stay unchanged at 70000 except the new distant February requirement

considering a merger company spokesmen said Toshin Steel owned 419 pct by Nippon Kokan and Azuma Steel owned 413 pct by Nippon Kokan are expected to decide by the end of March they said Both firms have been struggling with losses caused by the recession in the steel industry and the yen's appreciation Azuma Steel's current losses are estimated at 31 billion yen in the year ending March 31 against a 699 billion loss a year earlier a spokesman said The firm employs 1100 workers Toshin Steel with 1700 workers has given no forecast for the year ending March 31 But industry sources said they expected the company to show current losses of about five billion yen or more in 1986/87 compared with a 298 billion loss in 1985/86 customs-cleared trade surplus in the first 20 days of February jumped to 358 billion dlrs from 194 billion a year earlier the Finance Ministry said The February interim surplus was sharply up from a 96504 mln dlr surplus in the same January period FOB exports rose 146 pct from a year earlier in the first 20 days of February to 1091 billion while CIF imports fell 32 pct to 733 billion The average dollar/yen rates were 15232 for exports and 15231 for imports against 19661 for exports and 19627 for imports a year earlier Light Metal Co Ltd <NLGTT> which has annual capacity of 63000 tonnes will continue primary aluminium production at a rate of 35000 tonnes owing to low domestic and world prices and low water supplies at its hydroelectric power plant a company official said Nippon which has no plans to restore output to the 48000 tonnes a year at which it was working until late 1986 will become Japan's only smelter <Ryoka Light Metal Industries Ltd> will stop smelting in April owing to high power costs and low prices and <Mitsui Aluminium Co Ltd> has said it stopped smelting in February Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31 1988 from a projected 348 billion this year the company said Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5506 billion yen from a projected 5328 billion this year NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1770 billion yen in 1987/88 including 109 billion for research and development as against a total of 1600 billion this year An NTT spokesman said increased competition from new entrants to the telecommunications field and the effect of a sales tax scheduled to be introduced next January were the major factors behind the projected decrease in profits The Japanese telecommunications industry was deregulated in 1985 external reserves rose to a record 5173 billion dlrs at the end of February from the previous record of 5146 billion at end-January the Finance Ministry said End-February reserves last year were 2758 billion dlrs In January the nation's foreign reserves showed the largest-ever monthly increase at 922 billion dlrs due to massive Bank of Japan dollar buying intervention during the month as the dollar fell briefly to an all-time low of 14998 yen on January 19 foreign exchange dealers said Inc> a distributor for Ford Motor Co <F> in Japan is considering importing cars made by <Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp> (MMUC) a wholly owned US Subsidiary of Mazda Motor Corp <MAZTT> an Autorama spokesman said Mazda owned 24 pct by Ford is due to begin production of the 2000-cc-engine cars at the Michigan plant in September at an annual rate of 240000 of which between 60 and 70 pct will go to Ford and the rest to Mazda's own US Sales network securities houses will issue new corporate bonds more quickly accept issue requests throughout the month instead of at month-end and introduce a competitive underwriting method from April 1 to bring Japanese firms back to the Tokyo bond market securities managers said Domestic issues have slowed to a trickle as more and more companies turn to more flexible overseas markets for cash but the proposed moves are expected to pave the way for a review of public bond issues they said Relaxation of issue rules would be better applied not only to straight corporate bonds but also convertible bonds and warrant bonds to call back issuers effectively from overseas markets a Nikko Securities house bond manager said Securities houses will launch an issue about 10 days after a corporate declaration of intent instead of 25 days as now the securities managers said Underwriters are expected to abolish the lump-sum issuance system in which all corporate bonds are issued at month-end and accept issue requests during the month they said Securities houses also plan to introduce free competition among underwriters when negotiating with issuers over terms in order to better reflect the market securities managers said Market participants expect the new issue methods to be applied beginning in April with the projected issue by <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> The so-called proposal method abolishes the practice of taking lead-managership and enables more market-oriented decisions on terms securities sources said The four major Japanese securities houses now take turns underwriting corporate bonds Setting issue terms using financial criteria prepared by securities houses and in reference to coupon rates on latest public bonds is now almost automatic they said The new moves are based on wide-ranging proposals made in late December by advisers to Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa They were aimed at revitalising the domestic corporate bond market securities house managers said The finance ministry commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight and convertible bonds from March 1 securities managers said The cut will more than double the number of corporations able to make non-collateral issues from around 70 for straight bonds and 180 for convertibles now securities managers said The Bond Market Committee of the Securities Exchange Council also recommended introduction of a shelf registration system more use of corporate ratings systems and simplification of disclosure rules to help speed up the issuing process securities sources said It also called for a major review of the commissioned bank system which increases the cost of issuing domestic bonds and for deregulation of private placements they said Some of these proposals are likely to take some time to put into effect the sources said A shelf registration system would need a revision of Japanese commercial law expected in 1988 the sources said importers bought some 95000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment under the semi-annual trade accords trade sources said The FOB premium rose to 1350 dlrs per tonne up 250 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment but down from 1380 for the last May to September shipment Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans including spot buying may have totalled 240000 to 250000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment down from some 300000 tonnes the previous year the sources said Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240000 to 250000 tonnes a year the sources said In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers but low 1986 US Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing they said banks are expected to give Nigerian debt negotiators a cool response when they arrive here tomorrow for talks banking sources said We're not very enthusiastic about Nigeria's debt rescheduling said a senior official at a leading Japanese bank A team of Nigerian officials will meet with Japanese creditor banks here later this week to seek Japanese support for a proposed refinancing of part of Nigeria's 19 billion dlr foreign debt bankers said The senior bank official said a majority of Japanese bank creditors are unwilling to provide any new credits to Nigeria although about 80 pct have reluctantly agreed to accept rescheduling of part of their existing loans The problem is Nigeria has so far neglected us Japanese creditors and we have yet to receive a clear-cut picture of the nation's debt situation said another Japanese bank official He said Japanese bankers were unaware of the exact extent of Western commercial bank exposure to Nigeria and were uncertain about the proposed refinancing package details Some 21 Japanese banks have loans outstanding to Nigeria representing about four pct of the credit extended by Western commercial institutions banking sources said They said Nigeria would probably request about 320 mln dlrs in fresh private bank money and rescheduling of some 14 to 15 billion dlrs in existing loans due in 1986 and 1987 Japanese banks want Nigeria to make clear its debt repayment scheme as well as its economic reconstruction plans during the two-day meeting here the sources added Otherwise our response will be very negative the senior official said Banking sources said some 80 pct of international creditor banks involved have responded positively to the Nigerian debt proposal Bank of Japan officials said they hope Japanese commercial banks will help Nigeria overcome its debt problems Barclays Bank plc <BCSL> has the most exposure to Nigeria's debt and is chairing a bank steering committee looking at the problem the banking sources said BankAmerica Corp <BACN> is coordinating private bank creditors in the Far East and representing them on the committee they added Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is likely to leave office this summer amid opposition to his controversial tax-reform package political analysts said They said Nakasone's reputation as a skilled politician has suffered irreparable damage from his support of a five pct sales tax planned for January 1988 Nakasone is trying to carry out a drastic tax reform at the end of his administration which is not only impossible but also is very irresponsible as a politican Rei Shiratori professor of politics at Dokkyo University told Nakasone will almost certainly step down as soon as parliament approves the sales tax probably in the summer Shiratori said Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members of parliament have spoken against the tax which Nakasone says is needed to balance planned cuts in income and corporate taxes Nakasone today called for disciplinary action against LDP members who oppose the tax There are some who are objecting because of their constituencies he told a meeting of government and party leaders If the party discipline is broken I would like to see punishment considered A proposed sales tax has become a political issue partly because Nakasone breached his election pledge against introducing it Shiratori said Moreover the tax is being introduced when the public feels uncertainty about the sluggish economy stemming from the yen's appreciation and about the future when the Japanese society is rapidly aging he said Political analysts said the controversial tax could affect the more than 2500 local elections scheduled for April involving governors mayors town and village heads and assemblies at all levels But the situation is complicated since opposition parties excluding the communists sometimes put up joint candidates with the LDP the political analysts added Shiratori said In the worst case implementation of the sales tax now scheduled for next January may be put off for some time before the government makes a final decision Another alternative is to modify the planned five pct to perhaps three pct A third alternative for the government is to ram through the bills only with the attendance of LDP MPs he said Seizaburo Sato professor of politics at Tokyo University thought the last possibility most likely I think the LDP alone will take a vote on the tax bills he said The LDP now holds 304 seats in the 512-seat Lower House and 143 in the 252-seat Upper House To lure opposition parties back to parliament after the LDP pushes through the tax bills the Nakasone cabinet will have to resign Sato said Boycotting opposition members will be more willing to return to parliament if a new cabinet has been formed he said combined profits of Japan's major corporations excluding financial institutions are forecast to fall 192 pct in the 1986/87 year ending March 31 compared to the 199 pct decline projected in late November Wako Research Institute of Economics said The private research body also said in a statement that 437 of the 1084 firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange foresee an 116 pct fall in sales in the year against an 114 pct fall estimated last November Current profits are projected to fall 44 pct in 1987/88 on sales seen increasing by 42 pct it said Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook the institute said It said lower interest rates which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs are also behind the improved performance outlook Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses it said The forecast was based on average exchange rate estimates of 160 yen to the dollar in 1986/87 and 155 yen in 1987/88 Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs) a central bank official said The new guideline will go into effect on April 6 the bank said Under the guideline the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 05 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate the bank said But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same or 075 percentage point below the CD rates The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 037 point effective March 16 in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23 New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks for example will be 364 pct and 339 pct per annum respectively Demand deposit rates however will remain the same (Taiwan Power co) will boost its domestic borrowings to further cut its foreign debt in line with a government policy to trim the island's huge foreign exchange reserves a company official said The company's foreign debt mainly from the Japanese and US Banks was cut nearly by half to 662 billion taiwan dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 1246 billion in 1985 he said Its domestic borrowings however rose to 1052 billion taiwan dlrs from 806 billion in the same period he added Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now stood at 50 billion US Dlrs due to its 1986 record trade surplus of 156 billion Holdings Plc <RTRSL> said it would display an English language financial news service provided by the Japanese Jiji Press from the second quarter of 1987 The service which will be provided through the Monitor and Composite Information Service (CIS) will offer 24-hour reports on Japanese economic and political developments as well as specialised news on money markets and rates securities and technology Another Jiji service offering information on Japanese equity bond and money markets is also available on CIS AG <HFAGF> <Kerdix Inc> Boulder Colorado and <Nakamichi Corp> Tokyo have agreed to pool their research and development on magneto-optical memory discs Hoechst said in a statement Research will be carried out at each company and Hoechst will start to produce the discs by mid-1988 and distribute them worldwide under the brand name Ozadisc A Hoechst spokesman said an eventual joint venture was likely but could give no details consumers hesitated about buying the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on sale in Tokyo today but said the DAT player's near-perfect sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper The sound is great but I'll wait until more machines hit the market and prices fall to about 100000 yen before buying one said Terumi Fujitsuka 35 a steel firm employee Aiwa Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players today although delivery will take about two weeks retailers said Aiwa's machine the cheapest is listed at 188000 yen Machines by Sony Hitachi Toshiba and others will appear as early as the end of March industry sources said DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior to even a compact disc They use a cassette half the size of the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue machines they can make copies an infinite number of times with almost no loss of sound quality This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape piracy and loss of royalties In negotiations that delayed the DAT player's debut the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry be built into the machines Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to prevent copying through a digital signal But copies can still be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier Nobody can tell the difference one salesman said DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added But Japanese hardware makers hard pressed for profits in the era of the high yen and growing competition are eager to carve out a profitable niche Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly possibly to around 70000 yen by next year as other makers put their products on the market industry analysts said They said by 1990 sales could reach six mln units per year Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT player on the world market later this year and the US Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other The talks held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of US/Japan economic relations will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure the US Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus US Officials said We appreciate their frustration a senior Japanese government official said But we are also frustrated The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade but it will he said He said the US Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments a senior US Official replied The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance which last year amounted to 5148 billion dlrs in Japan's favour On the following two days the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing and the implications of government budget deficits These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more Some US Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports as Washington wants Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge US Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance That budget deficit has meant that the US Is buying more imports Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices It condemns Japan without due process one Japanese official said That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen he said Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the US Officials said Nevertheless Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them We have no leverage one official admitted As a result Tokyo is striving to meet US Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields including super computers The US Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers officials said appears resolved to encourage domestic demand for its goods instead of relying on exports to support its economy Jean-Claude Paye Director General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) told a news conference Paye has been in Japan exchanging views on problems confronting the world economy and the role of the OECD He met with Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and other high-ranking Japanese officials is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said US Banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of Brazil's debt to banks he said adding This is not fair with the European and Japanese banks The committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983 however Noting the often different reactions of US Japanese and European banks Funaro told journalists that Brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions Since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case-by-case basis Perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors central bank president Francisco Gros said Brazil on February 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth some 15 billion dlrs Funaro and Gros spent two days at the end of last week in Washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit Britain France West Germany Switzerland and Italy for discussions with governments Funaro and Gros are today meeting British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Governor of the Bank of England Robin Leigh-Pemberton Bankers have estimated that Brazil owes UK Banks around 85 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans giving the UK The third largest exposure after the US And Japan The crisis began when Brazil's trade surplus its chief means of servicing its foreign debt started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'sate of inflation Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs Funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with Brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt What we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service because we cannot service all that he said I really think we have to change the old rules Asked why Brazil was first approaching governments rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis Funaro said We must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks because the banks have some limits It is a political discussion from our point of view he said Funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to Japanese and Canadian government officials He would then talk to the commercial banks If I've got some solution from the governments I can't take the burden only to the banks He was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution  In discussions with governments Brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need Finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982 You must open these mechanisms he said He said that while the US Officials had been disturbed by Brazil's suspension of interest payments they understood Brazil had no other choice as it had to protect its reserves Also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed because we can't stay as we were the last few years I'm trying to put the problem on the table All of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium he said Although Brazil has rejected a substantive role for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in managing its economy Funaro paid a call in Washington to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and to World Bank President Barber Conable Funaro noted that inflation in February had started to decline again and he expected Brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987 Banking sources noted that Brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year against a monthly one billion in the first nine months Brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world Funaro said although its share of international trade was only one pct The solution is linked with growth not recession he said noting an IMF program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt Banking sources said Brazil's debts to foreign governments as opposed to commercial banks now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the Paris Club of creditor nations of 412 billion dlrs of official debt Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson has told Brazil's Finance Minister Dilson Funaro that negotiations on Brazil's debt to commercial banks are a matter for the commercial banks themselves a Treasury spokesman said The spokesman said the Chancellor had emphasised in talks this morning with Funaro the need for the Brazilian authorities to be able to present a convincing economic program to the country's creditors He added an accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be a very helpful support Brazil on February 20 suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its debts to commercial banks Lawson's attitude was interpreted by banking sources as a clear rebuff to Brazilian hopes of obtaining official cooperation in resolving its external debt crisis Funaro accompanied by central bank president Francisco Gros is on the first leg of a tour of European capitals in an attempt to explain to governments Brazil's indefinite suspension of interest payments earlier this month Brazil has in the past rejected a substantial role for the IMF in managing its economy arguing that an IMF austerity program by promoting exports and dampening domestic consumption would lead to recession and threaten democracy Funaro and Gros last week visited Washington as part of their trip to enlist support from governments for its attempts to change the means by which developing countries finance growth Funaro said on Saturday in Washington that Brazil would not have suspended payment on its debt if it had received more and faster financing from international agencies He said earlier today that Brazil was first approaching governments before talking to the commercial banks themselves about the interest payment moratorium because the banks have some limits It's a political discussion from our point of view Funaro said on Friday that his talks with US Officials had resulted in no new financial arrangement to help resolve Brazil's debt crisis describing the meeting as an initial contact He had earlier met Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker and US Treasury Secretary James Baker The Treasury spokesman pointed out that today's talks had been at Funaro's request After travelling this week to France Germany Switzerland and Italy Funaro hopes to visit Canada and Japan next week before starting negotiations with banks Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) expects its profits to fall to 328 billion yen in the year ending March 31 1988 from a projected 348 billion this year the company said Total sales for the same period are expected to rise to 5506 billion yen from a projected 5328 billion this year NTT said in a business operations plan submitted to the Post and Telecommunications Ministry NTT said it plans to make capital investments of 1770 billion yen in 1987/88 including 109 billion for research and development as against a total of 1600 billion this year Air Lines Inc said it began service from Atlanta to Tokyo today The carrier will fly single-plane through service departing daily from Atlanta and Tokyo five days a week it said Electric Corp said it agreed in principle to form a joint venture in factory automation with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd of Japan The company said the venture aims to combine Matsushita's experience in high-volume electronics manufacturing and Westinghouse's knowledge of computer integrated manufacturing The venture will design sell and service automated manufacturing systems and is expected to begin operations by the summer it added is not happy with the existing structure of the 14-bank advisory committee which

and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country'rate of inflation Reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 30 pct in January the worst since the Government started compiling unemployment statistics under its current system in 1953 up from the previous record 29 pct in December the government's Management and Coordination Agency said Unemployment was up from 28 pct a year earlier Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 182 mln people up from 161 mln in December and 165 mln a year earlier Male unemployment in January remained at 29 pct equal to the second-worst level set last December Record male unemployement of 31 pct was set in July 1986 Female unemployment in January remained at 30 pct equal to the record level marked in April August September and December last year January's record 30 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries particularly in export-related firms due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar officials said Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380000 from a year earlier to 1430 mln including 183 mln employed in the textile industry down 190000 from a year earlier and 106 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders down 170000 yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the US Dollar for about a year the Bank of Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150 at least for the rest of the year he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia Narusawa said the US Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the US Economy before the 1988 presidential election The yen is trading at around 15370 to the dollar investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices and on calculations gilt prices will firm bond managers said Japanese British and US Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains including city and trust banks which have been active on the US Treasury market they said Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said On the other hand major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year traders said These investors who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo a bond manager for a British securities house said The sterling/yen rate was about 24034/44 today up from 23450 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply However gilts may benefit from further declines in UK Interest rates they said The UK Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 95 pct against 9581 pct at yesterday's close in London unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 35 pct within the next year from January's three pct record senior economists including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan said December's 29 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953 There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment said Takashi Kiuchi senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd The government which published the January unemployment figures today did not make any predictions At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving a Labour Ministry official said Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries Other export-dependent industries such as cars and textiles have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring economists said Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down said Koichi Tsukihara Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department However other economists disagreed saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare economists warned The three pct figure could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used one economist said More than half of January's 170000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24 Sumitomo's Tsukihara said US Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years visiting US Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) a spokesman for Keidanren said The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress Wallis who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any US Trade bill is a moderate one rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country He was also quoted as saying the US Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three the spokesman said Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products A ban on rice imports triggered recent US Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the US To preserve a US-Japan pact on semiconductor trade but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate but those without it will not automatically be denied licences he said But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak US Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement The MITI spokesman said If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987 spokesmen for the firms said But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money a Hitachi Ltd <HITT> spokesman said major commercial banks plan to set up a joint company to which they will transfer assets acquired by lending to developing countries to build up a reserve against possible bad loans a senior official of a major bank told He said about 10 banks are likely to finish details of the project in a few weeks The intent is to avoid risk arising from unrecoverable debt owed by Third World countries he said Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan released its proposal for early creation of a comprehensive financial futures market in Tokyo The market should include a comprehensive range of futures and options trading so Tokyo can develop into a real global money centre where a variety of risk-hedging instruments is available the proposal said It should provide currency and interest rate futures and incorporate the existing yen bond futures and planned stock index futures contracts The proposal said transactions in all these contracts must be conducted on the same market so participants can readily engage in arbitrage between various financial instruments To make this possible the proposal calls for new legislation which would administer all related futures and options transactions under the same legal framework Banking sources said they expect that initially the currency futures would be dollar-yen and interest futures would include Japanese domestic yen certificates of deposit three-month Eurodollar deposits and 20-year US Treasury bonds Banking sources quoted federation chairman Yoshiro Araki as saying he hoped the market would be created as soon as possible because it would help promote the liberalisation of Japan's financial markets Araki said he had no intention of limiting prospective market participants to banks but was willing to accept those from wider business circles the sources said Japan's only current financial futures market in yen bonds began on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in October 1985 But the Osaka Stock Exchange plans to start futures trading in a basket of leading stocks in April looks likely to allow US Banks to conduct securities business here a move that will probably cause the barriers separating Japanese commercial banks from brokerage houses to break down financial analysts said But the timing of the approval remains uncertain due to conflicting domestic interests JPMorgan and Co <JPM> Bankers Trust New York Corp <BT> Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC> and Chemical Bank New York Corp <CHL> are expected to win approval to conduct securities business in Japan US Bank officials said There is no reason for extended delay of approval one official at a US Bank said The four US Banks have been seeking finance ministry approval for months To date Japan has allowed European banks to do securities business here through 50-pct owned subsidiaries As Japanese banks can conduct securities business in European countries this was seen as a reciprocal move and did not pave the way for Japanese banks to enter the domestic securities market But if US Banks win approval Japanese banks will press hard for similiar status since they are not allowed to conduct securities business in the US Many US Bank officials expect their applications to be approved before June But Japanese banking sources said the decision will be delayed until next year A spokesman for the finance ministry declined comment US Bankers will meet with ministry officials for talks on financial market deregulation sometime in the next few months Ministry sources said the talks are likely to be held in April or June At the last round of financial negotiations in September US Officials said Japan's commitment to deregulation was flagging Analysts said the finance ministry has been seriously considering the US Request since the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York approved five new primary government securities dealers including two Japanese brokerages last December They said the ministry will have to approve the US Request soon to head off criticism its markets are not as open to foreigners as those of the US Analysts said Japan has proceeded rapidly with financial deregulation since 1984 but has not touched upon the clear division between the securities and banking businesses Japanese banks and securities houses have fought hard to protect their interests but analysts said the banks are finding it increasingly difficult to earn money in traditional fields Officials of major Japanese banks said they will pay special attention to the ministry's reaction to US Bank requests because approval would accelerate market liberalization in Japan The Japanese bankers hope approval will pave the way for their own entry into the domestic securities market state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlruntied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said No further details on the loan were immediately available Ayala told an oil seminar the project due for completion in 1988 is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market mainly along the Pacific coast The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz Ayala said Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project he said The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product he added European <Airbus Industrie> consortium has signed a one billion dlr contract to sell 10 A320 short-haul jets to <All Nippon Airways> of Japan with an option on the sale of a further 10 planes an Airbus spokesman said today The 10 planes on firm order will be delivered between September 1990 and November 1991 and will be powered either by CFM-56-5S engines made by the Franco-US <CFM International> consortium or V2500S engines built by the <International Aero Engine> group The spokesman declined to comment on a New York Times report that Airbus is about to announce a sale to American Airlines But industry sources said American was about to announce the purchase of 25 wide-bodied planes from Airbus as well as 15 747s from Boeing Co <BAN> Airbus has already signed large deals with Pan Am Corp <PNN> NWA Inc <NWA> and Eastern Airlines Inc <EALN> as well as a smaller contract with <Continental Airlines> The A320 made its first flight on February 22 and is not due to enter commercial service until March next year The All Nippon purchase brings the total number of commitments to the A320 to 439 from 16 airlines comprising 275 firm orders and 164 options unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 35 pct within the next year from January's three pct record senior economists including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan said December's 29 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953 There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment said Takashi Kiuchi senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd The government which published the January unemployment figures today did not make any predictions At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving a Labour Ministry official said Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries Other export-dependent industries such as cars and textiles have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring economists said Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down said Koichi Tsukihara Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department However other economists disagreed saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years investor interest in British gilt-edged securities is growing rapidly due to expectations sterling will remain stable despite the drop in oil prices and on calculations gilt prices will firm bond managers said Japanese British and US Securities houses have been expanding inventories of gilts to meet demand from investors seeking capital gains including city and trust banks which have been active on the US Treasury market they said Dealing demand for gilts with coupons around 10 pct has been getting stronger the general manager of the local office of a British securities firm said On the other hand major long-term investors such as Japanese insurance companies are not very enthusiastic about buying British securities ahead of the March 31 close of the Japanese financial year traders said These investors who must convert yen into sterling through dollars for British securities purchases appear to be buying in London rather than in Tokyo a bond manager for a British securities house said The sterling/yen rate was about 24034/44 today up from 23450 at the start of the calendar year and a narrow range of 230 to 234 late last year Many bond traders in Tokyo are doubtful that sterling will further appreciate steeply However gilts may benefit from further declines in UK Interest rates they said The UK Government is in no hurry to issue more bonds suggesting further market improvement and continuing demand from brokers here said Laurie Milbank and Co assistant manager Machiko Suzuki She said she expected the yield on the actively traded 11-3/4 pct gilt due March 2007 to dip below 95 pct against 9581 pct at yesterday's close in London US Wants Japan to eliminate import controls on agricultural products within three years visiting US Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told Eishiro Saito Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) a spokesman for Keidanren said The spokesman quoted Wallis as saying drastic measures would be needed to stave off protectionist legislation by Congress Wallis who is attending a sub-cabinet-level bilateral trade meeting made the remark yesterday in talks with Saito Wallis was quoted as saying the Reagan Administration wants Japanese cooperation so the White House can ensure any US Trade bill is a moderate one rather than containing retaliatory measures or antagonising any particular country He was also quoted as saying the US Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three the spokesman said Japan currently restricts imports of 22 agricultural products A ban on rice imports triggered recent US Complaints about Japan's agricultural policy bought 5000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed overnight at an undisclosed price for April shipment trade sources said oil prices rallied today moving over 1700 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices analysts said The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting said Sanford Margoshes oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating he added Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december The analysts said that to get others to hold the line Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil analysts said They are trying to make sure that no one discounts and to prevent that it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales Margoshes said He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar which has had trouble selling oil But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts Analysts said that Saudi Arabia with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart Daniel McKinley oil analyst with Smith Barney Upham Harris and Co said both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo which refused discounts to Japanese buyers brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai which sent prices up on Mideast sours with Dubai trading up to 1650 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 1563 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments North sea brent today rose over 1700 dlrs with trades reported as high as 1705 dlrs up one dlr OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 158 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result Margoshes said Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors including demand which could cut the rally short Marion Stewart an indepedent petroleum economist said slow growth in the economies of the US and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 14 pct over 1986 of American wine rose 149 per cent last year to a total of 72 million gallons the Wine Institute said The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent of the exported wine was from California and the top three markets were Canada Japan and Britain Japan which edged out Britain as the leading importer of American wines in 1985 continued in second place Canadian imports rose 32 per cent to 26 million gallons; Japan 99 per cent to 12 million gallons and Britain 202 per cent to 962360 gallons A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the California wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments The 1986 wine exports were valued at 347 mln dlrs up from 276 mln dlrs the previous year traders have apparently sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next six months due to high prices the US Agriculture Department said In its World Production and Trade Report the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices If the reports are confirmed China's major export destinations such as USSR Japan and South Korea could increase purchases of US corn it said China is currently forecast to export 55 mln tonnes of corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) it said Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he felt a proposed takeover by Japan's <Fujitsu Ltd> of US-based Fairchild Semiconductor Corp a subsidiary of Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> should be carefully reviewed He told the Semiconductor Industry Association the deal would soon be discussed by representatives of several different government departments The Reagan administration has previously expressed concern that the proposed takeover would make Fujitsu a powerful part of the US market for so-called supercomputers at a time when Japan has not bought any American-made supercomputers In addition US defense officials have said they were worried semiconductor technology could be transferred out of the United States eventually giving Japanese-made products an edge in American high-technology markets for defense and other goods Treasury Secretary James Baker recently told a Senate committee the proposed takeover would be reviewed by the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council Corp said Nippon Steel Co of Japan in a move to diversify into high technology invested eight mln dlrs in GTX Nippon's move was the result of current exchange rates and the revaluation of the yen which have made the US electronics industry an attractive investment opportunity for Japanese corporations according to a GTX statement GTX noted that Nippon is expecting sales of 27 billion dlrs by 1995 Of that amount six billion dlrs is targeted for electronics GTX located in Phoenix makes computerized systems that read drawings and transfer them into data bases Hokkaido Bank Ltd is issuing a 30 mln dlr convertible eurobond due March 31 2002 with an indicated 2-1/4 pct coupon and priced at par lead manager Nomura International Ltd said Terms will be fixed on March 10 involving a premium of about five pct above a six-day average The conversion period will run from April 20 1987 to March 20 2002 The bonds will be sold in denominations of 5000 dlrs and will be listed in Luxembourg Total fees of 2-1/2 pct include one pct for management and underwriting and 1-1/2 pct for selling including an 20 basis point praecipuum Nomura said the bonds are callable from March 31 1990 at 104 declining by 1/2 pct per annum There will be no calls before March 31 1992 unless the share price reaches at least 150 pct of the conversion price Chemical Co Ltd said it had developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to 10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now he said of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing US trade deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement Speaking to the President's Export Council an industry advisory group Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under discussion with those countries I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably won't be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us he said In a wide-ranging discussion on US trade matters Baldrige also repeated US concern about an attempted takeover by Japan's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing US companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to acquire control of a US company that does major computer business in the US market Lastly Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by the autumn but said major issues including acid rain remained unresolved Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for US banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments Previously the Fed Jan 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset which would reflect the replacement cost Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and US banking regulators Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity They ignore for example the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks which are the principal participants in these types of activities They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of US banks to compete in world financial markets However the staff concluded The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the UK-US effort to draft new capital rules of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization ICO coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States particularly the State Department to reassess its position but the US is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by objective criteria US officials said Jon Rosenbaum assistant US trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks told on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary Rosenbaum said the United States will be flexible in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas At the ICO talks major consuming nations led by the US proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil by far the world's largest producer Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the US customs service to monitor coffee imports as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks but nobody is proposing we change our position However other US government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries led by Brazil and Colombia to soften the consumer position Knowing that its next crop is fairly large Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers said one US official The US official who asked not to be identified said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries faced with mounting debt problems to the US State department and to the National Security Council in the White House for an easing of the US position US officials said The State department a major player in setting US coffee policy may then face conflicting pressures particularly from politically-sensitive US allies in Central America US officials said El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group which said it would agree to objective criteria There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question US officials said Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions In London the US was supported by the UK the Netherlands West Germany Japan Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria US officials said This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals However US sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult although not impossible for the US to block producer plans While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important US officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position US officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement Department of Transportation said that an administrative law judge had recommended that small package service between the United States and Tokyo be granted to Federal Express Corp <FDX> A final decision by the department is expected within 90 days In addition the department said the law judge recommended that backup service be granted to <Orion Air Inc> The order if finally approved would be for five years in the case of Federal and one year in the case of Orion Korea's record 71 billion dlrs trade surplus with the US is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of US companies Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued and denied any plans for a drastic and sudden revaluation Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 US cities Last year South Korea ran a 43 billion dlr trade surplus including a record 71 billion surplus with the US and a 55 billion dlr deficit with Japan Rha told in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 20 billion dlrs in purchases from US companies about a quarter of which represents transferred purchases from Japanese sources Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are mainly chemicals machinery and parts He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of US agricultural products The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy substantial amounts of cotton from the US He noted his country is clearly not as open as the American market Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the US- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors David Woods spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15 The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the US Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips officially known as semiconductors The EC Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave US Producers preferential access to the Japanese market Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong Canada Switzerland Singapore Sweden Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate Japan's delegate Minoru Endo and US Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the EC Charges were unfounded but they were willing to continue bilateral talks growth in corporate profits and in consumer spending the two pillars on which Japan rests its hopes of sustained economic growth both look rotten at the core economists polled by said Profits and domestic consumption are meant to replace exports as the engine of growth But close ties between corporate performance and wages mean that the alternative economic model promises little but slower growth they said Falling profits may lead to falling incomes which in turn will cut sales and further reduce profits The Bank of Japan said in its latest outlook that improved terms of trade linked to the strong yen would help domestic demand grow steadily However this would happen only if household spending increased in line with the value of real financial assets due to stable prices and/or if corporate investment recovered as profits from domestic sales improved compared with those from exports No clear sign of such developments has so far been evidenced the central bank said Poor business prospects are the reason why economic growth will be slow even though Japan's terms of trade have improved sharply due to the strong yen Economist David Pike of Phillips and Drew estimates that in 1986 unit cost prices fell 30 pct while output prices fell only eight pct giving a large price margin advantage in the domestic market -- as long as companies did not pass that advantage on to the consumer Last year's gap of almost 10 percentage points between the fall in the wholesale price index and the slight drop in consumer prices shows that gains from the improved terms of trade have been kept as profits by producers and distributors The economists however believe this layer of fat will protect companies for only a short while As more firms seek more profits at home instead of abroad already fierce domestic competition will increase fueled by lower-priced imports Retail prices will fall Profit margins will suffer A December survey by top business organisation Keidanren confirms this dim view is taken by the firms themselves Of companies polled in the key manufacturing sector almost 80 pct thought the high yen would create a drop in production volume and 60 pct predicted a drop in corporate performance said Keidanren economist Kazuyuki Kinbara Main counter-measures cited by the firms include cutting unprofitable operations reducing work to sub-contractors (which employ significant numbers of workers) holding down wages and reducing bonuses The government has said it fears unemployment could soon double from three pct now Unemployment and slow wage growth will obviously hurt sales But reduced bonuses and worries about individual financial security could be even more damaging Twice a year bonuses provide wage earners with what amounts to an enforced lump sum in savings encouraging them to buy large consumer products and sparking a sales bonanza To save funds some big firms have begun a form of tied bonus forcing employees to spend it on the firm's own goods Economists also predict Japanese will not save less than the average 16 pct of salary they do now On the contrary a poor outlook and lower disposable income could strengthen the resolve to put money aside for old age and illness education and housing -- the main drains on the working man's salary The last government survey of public opinion said over 80 pct of citizens will continue to economise Japan has a rapidly ageing population and minimal social security and its workers fear poverty in their old age Faced with such a vicious circle the government's reflationary strategies are severely limited The commitment by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and Finance Ministry to cut the state debt has resulted in small supplementary budgets and attempts to provide fiscal incentive without reducing revenue Independent economists have been less than excited at the results Provision for monetary stimulus is similarly limited The 25 pct discount rate is so low it is politically impossible to cut it further with the basic bank savings rate at only 025 pct Bank of Tokyo economist Haruo Muto said Almost 60 pct of Japanese still hold their savings in some kind of deposit official figures show Moves to directly inject liquidity are unproductive while firms are planning cuts in capital investment The central bank is well aware that soaring stock and land prices are the only current results of high liquidity Fear of inflation also limits policy options Political analysts ascribe Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's 1986 big election victory largely to a long period of almost zero price inflation And he found this year that attempts to impose a sales tax to offset tax cuts arouses fierce voter opposition consortium of electrics industry firms to challenge Japan's presence in the global semiconductor market was announced by the Semiconductor Industry Association The initiative will be funded by US manufacturers to develop the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technologies the association said at a news conference Government participation and financial support will also be sought for the consortium called SEMATECH for semiconductor manufacturing technology We can continue to sit back and watch the Japanese target and assualt yet another critical US industry Or we can get in gear and do what is necessary to repell this attack said Irwin Federman chief executive officer of Monolithic Memories Inc He said the objective of SEMATECH a non profit corporation was to maintain leadership in an industry that was vital to the US economy and national security The plan was for SEMATECH to establish a facility at various manufacturers and equipment suppliers to pioneer advanced manufacturing techniques for semiconductors Express Corp said it received a recommendation from an administrative law judge that it be awarded the exclusive air express route between the US and Japan Federal Express said the recommendation now must be approved by the Secretary of Transporation Elizabeth Dole and President Reagan Federal Express said it received late last year preliminary approval by a panel over a consortium of United Parcel Service and DHL and other air express competitors from beef producing states and representatives of the US livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues Rep Hal Daub (R-Nebr) said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea Daub was joined by several other lawmakers US assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley replied we're not going to let Japan off the hook or Korea She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues Japan maintains a quota on beef imports set at 58400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987 South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to US pressure and allow some imports soon industry officials said In testimony today Tom Cook director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said the Congress administration and the industry must take a strong tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets plan by US semiconductor firms to cooperate in a manufacturing facility to compete with firms in Japan could conflict with anti-monopoly law the plan's backers said The Semiconductor Industry Association announced at a news conference a plan for a consortium to be known as SEMATECH to build an advanced semiconductor manufacturing plant Asked whether US antitrust regulators might object Charles Sporck president of National Semiconductor Corp said That is a possibility Sporck said the Defense Department had a strong interest in the project but he declined to estimate how much would be sought from the government or how much funding SEMATECH would require Sporck said the group hopes to have an operational plan ready by June 1 Then it will search for a site for the manufacturing facility and an executive to head up the consortium The consortium could be operating by the end of the year and the facility working in 18 months he said International Business Machines Corp hopes to participate in the effort Paul Low an IBM executive said He said the project suppliers of raw materials and others vital to the semiconductor industry such as toolmakers would be invited to participate Sporck said no decision was made on what product would be produced stressing that the emphasis was on developing technology and sharing that with firms which belonged to SEMATECH Other aspects were still undecided such as whether a Japanese firm with a facility in the United States would be allowed to participate he said Commerce Secretary Claude Pope said Japan's Okuma Machinery Works LTD will build a multi-million dollar manufacturing machinery plant here He said the plant will be the company's first in the US and will employ approximately 150 people He said start-up date is set for late this year state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts chairman Louis Lo said He told in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture to build two hulls for <Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd> was a success Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd <MITHT> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMAT> he said Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi which would complete production We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future Lo said He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln US Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975 Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs But he said the company which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification he said Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln US Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87 CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year compared with 11 ships of 462000 dwt in 1985/86 he said Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage but the outlook for ship repairing was bright group of creditor banks hopes to work out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd <JLITT> one of the world's largest tanker operators by the end of Japan's business year on March 31 a spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd <IBJTT> (IBJ) said Japan Line's cumulative debt was 6898 billion yen at the end of September which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 6340 billion In December Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares The spokesman for IBJ Japan Line's largest creditor said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long Commenting on the article he said the details of the package have not yet been settled wheat shipments rose to 133 mln tonnes in February from 101 mln in January an Australian Wheat Board official said February's shipments were down on the 154 mln tonnes shipped in February 1986 Cumulative shipments for the first five months of the October/September wheat year were 612 mln tonnes as against 654 mln a year earlier the official said The major destinations in February were: China (419196 tonnes) Egypt (301909) Iraq (142055) Japan (110261) South Korea (100847) and the Soviet Union (100056 tonnes) countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Subroto attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand If we stick to the production limitation the third quarter will be in better balance He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices Subroto said: Apparently they have taken care of that They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves I think they'll help each other he said Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because  Everyone is sticking to official prices he said easing of rules governing overseas use of the yen has caused an explosion of Euroyen bond activity but has failed to turn the yen into a truly international currency bond managers and traders said Although yen bonds now rank second only to dollar issues in the Eurobond market few foreigners are interested in keeping the yen they borrow and no one wants the yen bonds but the Japanese they said This lack of real yen demand through the freer Euroyen market is undermining the 1984 US And Japanese accord to internationalise the yen they said The borrowers want to take advantage of low Japanese interest rates but have no need for yen They arrange primarily with Japanese banks to exchange yen funds into other currencies mainly dollars bond managers said More than 85 pct of Euroyen bond issues are swap driven they added The borrowers don't care which currency they use They are only after attractive money one bond trader said Issues doubled to more than 150 in 1986 from the previous year boosting Euroyen offerings to more than nine pct of the total Eurobond market Koichi Kimura managing director of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said recently Traders said some of the activity stems from battles among Japanese and foreign securities companies and banks for the prestige of placing a larger share of issues Many even resort to harakiri swaps those with unprofitable pricing But the fever continues and the number of offerings could double again in 1987 said Naoki Yokoyama manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's international capital markets operation The Euroyen bonds once issued are mostly picked up by Japanese trust banks one trader said After a 90 day waiting period the bonds flow back to Japan where investor appetite is strong he added Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in yen when more attractive yields are offered on dollar and other currency investments traders said Even aggressive foreign investors have stopped investing (in yen) said Masaki Shimazu manager of Daiwa's bond department While few foreigners are interested in the secondary market Japanese commercial banks regional banks life insurers and other financial institutions are eager to buy the bonds and await their flow back to Japan since they offer little currency risk traders said The Finance Ministry last April shortened the waiting period before issues could flow back to Japan to 90 days from 180 A ministry official said it verified through sampling that reflow was fairly small We believe the Euroyen bond should remain mainly in the Euroyen market he said One trader said that although demand from Japanese investors is heavy it may prove to be only short-term He said many investors plan to sell their bonds if Japanese or US Interest rates decline further To encourage further international use of the yen the ministry is considering allowing the issue of Euroyen commercial paper the official said adding that it is studying demand from potential borrowers Securities company sources believe the ministry will permit non-residents to issue Euroyen commercial paper within the next few months But they expect it to continue to ban domestic participation in the market for some time to come Japanese banks object to the short-term paper market which they see encroaching on their business territory Traders said Euroyen commercial paper could spur more demand overseas for the yen by allowing opportunities to shift into shorter-term securities if need be Commercial paper might encourage fewer swaps one bond manager said If more financial instruments were available there might be more trades in yen he added Euroyen bonds must now carry a five-year maturity though some recent issues which are callable in three years work as if they had shorter maturities traders said The ministry is expected to allow four-year Euroyen bond maturities within a few months One yen bond manager said Japanese financial authorities are giving up a lot of their control in liberalising the rules governing international transactions of the yen But freer use of the yen could encourage more trade settlements in the Japanese currency he said If exporters or importers can raise funds in yen they will be more willing to agree to using the Japanese yen as a settlement currency he added The Finance Ministry official said the government must constantly consider ways to improve markets for the benefit of borrowers and investors No major market can keep its status without change he said has decided to redeem six years early a 20 billion yen 12-year 85 pct samurai bond due on August 18 1993 Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said as lead manager It will redeem 184 billion yen at 10300 and the rest at par this August 18 under an annual redemption obligation probably because of declining yen interest rates Daiwa said Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 500 billion yen of financing bills it holds to help absorb a projected money market surplus money market traders said Of the total 300 billion yen will yield 39989 pct on the sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in 27-day repurchase agreement due April 2 The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 39994 pct in a 39-day repurchase pact maturing on April 14 they said The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 40625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 450/43 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit Tomorrow's surplus in the money market is estimated at 420 billion yen mainly due to payment of national annuities money traders said The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 1300 yen shr 1834 yen vs 5872 Net 1073 billion

yen's appreciation during the period Domestic sales rose 04 pct to 27417 billion yen from a year earlier while exports declined 99 pct to 61504 billion highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions Japanese and European research officials said The officials looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations told the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-US Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis to the discomfort of Europe In many ways not least in terms of rare international cooperation the September 1985 New York Plaza pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance but not necessarily central significance the officials said The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place the dollar was already on its way down The agreement simply helped it on its way Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now and that was well before Plaza he said On February 25 1985 the dollar peaked against the yen at 26315 yen On September 20 the Friday before Plaza it was 242 Since then despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action the dollar trend has been down down down Yet the ECU is now around 1734 yen The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story The European currencies are moving back up against the yen The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing In 1986 Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms five pct in yen This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus Last January Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the US against about a third in recent years Trade with the US in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms which is what is important to them Suddenly instead of the US It is Europe that is laying the golden egg said de Hora The EC is worried EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base compared with total Japan-US Trade The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than US Firms a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance and which will cause problems This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries But therefore Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge said Azusa Hayashi Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry If you want my objective view I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance Last year we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said exported 1816 tonnes of tin metal in January up from 1731 in December and 1330 a year ago the Mineral Resources Department said It said major buyers last month were Singapore Japan Britain the Netherlands Malaysia and the US state-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning April 1 trade sources said Japan the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of around 23 mln tonnes a year has asked India to reduce prices from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne the sources said Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price one source said but declined to give further details creditor banks are close to a decision to jointly establish an offshore firm to which they will transfer part of their title to possibly unrecoverable debts owed by developing nations international financial sources told Details of the deal are likely be decided next week and the firm set up before the end of the month they said The scheme is intended to improve financial management at the banks and reduce the risk of problems in the event of debts turning bad the sources said Last week's announcement by Brazil that it would indefinitely suspend interest payments on an estimated 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks prompted Japanese creditors to finalise the project the sources said Major Japanese banks have been considering a plan to avoid a debt crisis since the start of the year they said There are likely to be at least 10 participating banks and perhaps as many as 28 they said About 30 Japanese commercial banks have outstanding loans totalling over 10 billion dlrs to Brazil accounting for about 15 pct of all commercial loans to that country The most likely venue for the envisaged firm is the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands the sources said The idea is to create a pool of funds in the firm with participating creditor banks holding the firm's stock The firm will then use the funds to buy from its stock-holding banks title to repayments of specified foreign loans which are potentially bad the sources said The stock-holding banks will draw up a list of such loans Subject to the scheme would be loans extended to debt-ridden countries such as Mexico and Argentina they said The financial sources said interest payments to the firm would not be taxed because of its location Japanese banks have asked the finance ministry to increase tax breaks on loan loss reserves but the ministry has not yet complied A senior ministry official welcomed the scheme and said it may encourage new lending to developing countries The ministry instructs banks to establish reserves for up to five pct of their loans to 35 financially troubled countries but it only grants tax breaks on reserves accounting for one pct of the loans Ministry of International Trade and Industry has not yet set a car export quota for <Daihatsu Motor Co Ltd> which is scheduled to start exports to the US Later this year a ministry official said Several local newspapers said the ministry had set a quota of about 10000 cars Daihatsu is owned 151 pct by Toyota Motor Corp <TOYOT> Quotas for nine car makers including Daihatsu are likely to be set before the end of March the official said and Co Ltd said it plans to issue 300 mln Eurodollar warrant bonds in two tranches with payment on March 30 through a syndicate led by Nomura International Ltd One tranche is of five-year 150 mln dlr bonds while the rest is of seven-year 150 mln dlr bonds but other issue terms have not yet been decided Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas much needs to be done he told a press conference after three days of talks What we need is a resolution of trade issues we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986 He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips supercomputers Kansai airport agricultural products and car telephones He warned that the US/Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy Despite the pact Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while US Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased he said of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) Noboru Gotoh called on the Government to issue additional construction bonds as an emergency measure to stimulate domestic demand Gotoh told a press conference that increased fiscal spending is the only alternative to prop up the economy as credit conditions are easy enough a JCCI spokesman said Japan faces serious unemployment unless more construction bonds to raise cash for public works are issued but Japan should continue to carry out fiscal reform programmes Gotoh said private plant and equipment investment will grow 01 pct in fiscal 1987 starting April 1 from 1986 due mainly to a continued slump in manufacturing sector spending the Japan Development Bank said Capital spending by manufacturing industries hit hard by the rise of the yen will fall 56 pct a survey said Planned investment by non-manufacturing firms will grow four pct as industries like leasing and transport that have benefitted from the yen's rise will remain robust it said The 01 pct overall increase compares to the 31 pct rise the bank projected for the current fiscal year In the manufacturing sector iron and steel companies are the most pessimistic with an estimated 180 pct spending cut Investment by precision machinery and textile firms will decline by 18 pct and 112 pct respectively the survey said In the non-manufacturing sector transport and leasing service industries are expected to increase their spending by 157 pct and 106 pct respectively The bank's survey conducted in early February was based on questionnaires from 1738 corporations in all sectors having a business relationship with the bank ruling Liberal Democratic Party started moves to push through the delayed draft budget for 1987/88 through Parliament deepening a clash with the opposition which called the move rash and unforgivable In the absence of the opposition LDP members of parliament decided at a meeting of the Lower House Steering Committee to hold a public hearing on the draft budget on March 13 and 14 parliamentary officials said The step came after Parliament resumed deliberations last Tuesday following a month-long opposition boycott over a controversial government-proposed sales tax plan Four opposition parties led by the Socialists have been delaying budget deliberations in a bid to shelve the sales tax on which the budget plan is based A Socialist spokesman said the opposition would again boycott parliament unless the LDP changed its mind Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone who has vowed to push through the tax reforms told reporters: Watching closely negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties I would like to avoid  Passing (the budget) singlehandedly The five pct tax part of Nakasone's tax reform plan is planned to start next January to help offset cuts in individual income and corporate tax The opposition objected to fixing a date for the hearing because the LDP could technically stop deliberations on the budget and ram it through the budget committee and then a Lower House plenary session political analysts said The four opposition parties called the LDP move an unforgivable rash act and said they would fight to scrap the sales tax and

coupon and 100-1/4 issue price lead manager Swiss Bank Corp said The issue is guaranteed by Fuji Bank Payment is due March 17 Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he may recommend that the United States retaliate against Japan if the Japanese do not permit US construction firms to participate in building the eight billion dlr Kansai airport But he said he had a personal commitment from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that US firms would have a chance at the work I think he will honor that commitment Baldrige told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on commerce affairs He said one form of retaliation could be to curb Japanese firms' two billion dlr construction work in the United States said it signed a license agreement with British Telecommunications PLC <BTYL> to make and market a test instrument for digital microwave communications equipment Tekelec said the new product is expected to be priced at 25000 dlrs and to be shipped in the second half of 1987 The 20-year non-exclusive agreement grants Tekelec the right to manufacture and market the instrument in North America and Japan reduction of the US federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit US trade representative Clayton Yeutter said Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yeutter said Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now Unless we get the budget deficit down we will not get the trade deficit down He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits Private analysts have said that the financing of large US budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of US Treasury and to a lesser extent other US securities as well We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987 but there's still a long way to go Yeutter said He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on US and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth US competitiveness and the establishment of a level playing field for trade The US trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down On the fiscal side Yeutter said the budget deficit is still our biggest problem and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit In the international area he said that our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth Commenting on Japan which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States Yeutter said Japan is just not doing the job on the import side Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end Yeutter said However he added that if the US and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the US trade deficit the dollar will be the equalizer Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers He said there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by US trading partners Yeutter said There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation Yeutter said adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the US Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly

we asked for moderation in exports and this year we may have to do so again he said Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada principally into the country's bond market is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar He said the inflow of funds mainly from Japan Europe and the United States is the result of confidence in the direction this country is going in That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (US) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 231 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986 more than double the previous year with Japan investing a record 95 billion dlrs in the market Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad Canadian investment including the buying of foreign companies stocks and bonds rose to 1253 billion dlrs from 619 billion dlrs in 1985 The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada sales gained 2494900 tonnes in the week ended February 26 the highest weekly total since August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's level the US Agriculture Department said In comments on its Export Sales Report the department said sales of 10 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the US-USSR Grains Supply Agreement which began October 1 Japan added 689700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429800 tonnes Wheat sales of 362400 tonnes for the current season and 151000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from the previous week's combined sales it said Egypt Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for delivery in the current year while sales to China decreased by 30000 tonnes for the current season but increased by 90000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season which begins June 1 Net sales of soybeans totalling 274200 tonnes equaled the preceding week but were nearly a third below the four week average Major increases were for Belgium South Korea Mexico and Italy it said Soybean cake and meal sales of 103700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low but six pct less than the four week average Major increases for West Germany Belgium Spain Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations Soybean oil sales of 5400 tonnes were the result of increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for unknown destinations Combined sales activity in cotton of 75200 running bales -- 44700 bales for the current year and 30500 bales for the 1987/88 bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good showing the department said Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea Japan Taiwan and Thailand while South Korea and Indonesia were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season which begins August 1 Finance Minister Dilson Funaro will extend his international tour flying to Japan for talks with government officials and representatives of banks to explain Brazil's decision to halt payment of part of its 109-billion dlrs foreign debt Finance Ministry sources said Funaro who is in Rome today will fly to Tokyo on Sunday after having completed a week-long trip to the United States France England Italy West Germany and Switzerland Brazil halted payment of interest rates on 68 billion dlrs owed to 700 private commercial foreign banks as part of an strategy to alleviate the burden of its commitments Funaro who is accompanied by Central Bank governor Francisco Gros met only with government officials of the countries visited over the week In Tokyo however he is due to meet private bankers to whom Brazil owes some 68 billion dlrs the sources said He is due back in Brasilia next Wednesday March 11 the sources added Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) said its Far East customers would be charged 1725 dlrs per barrel for Isthmus crude in February and 1445 dlrs for the heavier Maya Pemex said this was 32 cts less than January Isthmus and 15 cts less than January Maya Far East customers primarily Japan which buys an average 180000 barrels per day of which 150000 is Isthmus pay retroactively while European and US clients are charged per delivery Secretary James Baker said there has been no change in US policy on the value of the dollar Baker when asked if the policy was changed in view of comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the dollar by 10 to 15 pct replied No Yesterday Robert Ortner Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs said he thought the yen was undervalued but said that was his personal view This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions Baker who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper Association declined to elaborate on his statement about US policy Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Japanese trade surplus would begin to decline this year He told the National Newspaper Association You're going to see a reduction in the Japanese trade surplus -- some of it this year But he said the reduction would be due principally to the exchange rate shifts since the Plaza Agreement and these shifts would take a long time to work their way through the system government's move to pare its huge financing costs by shortening debt maturities has left more room for other borrowers and sparked a lively market for treasury bills senior market analysts said The Bank of Canada Ottawa's fiscal agent in the marketplace revealed this week that sharply reduced borrowing needs has allowed the shift toward shorter bond terms and heavier emphasis on the weekly treasury bill auction issued in terms of up to one year The aggressive use of the treasury bill program has meant that the government is now able to maintain lower cash balances and lower financing costs the Bank of Canada said in its 1986 annual report released this week The government has said its budget deficit financing requirements will fall to 24 billion dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31 1987 from 30 billion dlrs the prior year Projected fiscal 1988 requirements are 213 billion dlrs The bank said that of last year's 19 new government bond issues nearly two-thirds were for maturities of less than 10 years Greater use was also made of bond auctions to market new issues with terms in the two- to five-year range Meanwhile treasury bills outstanding at year end totalled nearly 70 billion dlrs an increase of 103 billion dlrs over the year and 20 billion dlrs since 1984 Although the amount of money saved from moving away from the long bonds was not disclosed bond experts believe it was considerable because of the much lower interest premiums paid on short term debt But market watchers were unsure what affect the move will have on Japanese investors--who have been snapping up Canadian bonds at a record clip--because of their traditional preference for long term financings Bond traders said the Japanese who purchased a record 95 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds last year have adapted to the changes by buying longer term provincial issues and shifting to the medium term issues offered by Ottawa Their (Japanese) buying over the course of the last six months has been very much concentrated in the medium term maturities noted one Canadian bond trader who asked not to be identified Yet there was some concern a shortage could eventually develop for bonds that mature in 10 or more years Said David Gluskin vice-president of Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc When interest rates finally seem to have stopped going down there is going to be a flood of people trying to lock in the long end and not everyone will be able to get in the door But bonds analysts said at the moment with interest rates trending down investors appear to welcome the change especially the greater treasury bill financing The wholesale market in treasury bills is very active said Michael Berry vice-president of the securities firm Walwyn Stodgell Cohran Murray Ltd The change also improves receptivity in the market for other borrowers including provincial governments the big utilities and corporations There doesn't seem to any lack of bonds in the longer end now that also may be the result that any percieved shortage has probably been taken up by provincial funding activities commented Berry director of the Treasury Department's office of international banking and portfolio investment said Japan should open its bond and stock markets to more US firms The Treasury would like to see greater openness of Jaspanese markets including more US firms admitted to the Tokyo Stock Exchange and an increased role for US financial firms in the Japanese Government bond market Ammerman said in a prepared speech for a conference on financial services sponsored by Georgetown University Ammerman also said the Reagan administration hopes any discrimination against US banks wishing to set up in the securities business in Japan in their own name will be eliminated promptly He said the United States also was pressing Canada to stop giving favored treatment to domestic banks over US competitors and was talking with Canadian representatives He said the United States will press vigorously for liberalization of financial services in all foreign markets If negotiations fail We will not hesitate to take vigorous actions to promote or protect our interests he added Liposome Co Inc said it and its wholly-owned subsidiary Liposome Japan Co Ltd will sponsor a major seminar on liposome at Tokyo University on March 12 1987 Liposomes are microscopic man-made spheres composed of lipids that can be engineered to entrap drugs or other biologically active molecules within the lipid membranes of the spheres or in the aqueous space between the membranes the company explained Leading academic research and government institutions in Japan are expected to attend the company said Reserve Board member Robert Heller said the trend toward global financial markets required that all participants be treated even-handedly on such matters as bank capital requirements The recent US-UK agreement on capital adequacy provided a model for others including Japan Heller told a Georgetown University conference on financial markets If they (the Japanese bank) want to do more business in Europe or the United States they have got to adhere to international standards he said Heller said there were talks currently between the United States and Japan on bank rules He said the trend toward internationalization in financial services would cause markets to move to centers with the least regulation That is not desirable We want to have a sensible amount of regulation Heller said Soviet Union has agreed to cut its coking coal export prices to Japanese steel mills by about five dlrs a tonne in 1987/88 starting April 1 in exchange for an increase in export volume industry sources said The prices were set at 44 dlrs a tonne for Neryungrinsky coal and at 4380 dlrs for Kuznetsky coal fob Japan will import a total of 49 mln tonnes from both areas up from 42 mln a year earlier they said The steelmakers had asked Moscow to agree to a cutback to 37 mln tonnes in 1987/88 but the Soviet Union urged Japan to increase the amount to 65 mln they said Japanese credit rating agencies are entering into fierce competition with <Moody's Japan KK> and <Standard and Poor's Asia Inc> the local branches of the two US Giants as the Japanese credit market opens up to foreigners Japanese rating agency managers said Standard and Poor's recent triple-A rating of <Chiyoda Fire and Marine Insurance Co Ltd's> claims-paying ability caused the Japanese agencies which had rated Chiyoda's convertible bond only A-plus to come under some criticism for being too conservative they said Chiyoda is Japan's eighth largest non-life insurer Standard and Poor's Corp has been in the business for more than a century while <Moody's Investors Service Inc> was founded more than 80 years ago Each has rated some 20000 to 30000 US And about 100 Japanese issues With Japanese insurers eager to issue more bonds through overseas financing companies Chiyoda's rating will stimulate their interest in using the US Agencies the analysts said Standard and Poor's said Chiyoda's rating was based on its strong capitalisation stable performance and high levels of unrealised appreciation particularly in its stock portfolio The US Agency also emphasised the favourable regulatory environment in which Japan's non-life insurers operate Japanese agencies were shocked by the earlier AAA ratings on the claims-paying ability of <Sumitomo Life Insurance Co> and <Dai-Ichi Mutual Life Insurance Co> by Standard and Poor's the first ratings given to Japanese life insurers Strong Japanese insurers can accumulate cash to ward off shocks from any foreign investment Standard and Poor's said A month ago <Nippon Investors Service Inc> (NIS) assigned an AAA rating to <Financial Securities Assurance Inc> a US Firm that gives financial guarantees on corporate securities NIS has assigned rates on a US Firm for the first time in Japan which was the first step into the US Rating market Kazuya Kumura general manager of NIS said Kyosuke Yoshida managing director of Japan Bond Research Institute (JBRI) said Agencies should be more actively used to respond better to growing overseas investor interest Takeshi Watanabe president of Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd (JCRA) said (Our) advantages are that we have a deeper understanding of business practices in Japan other Asian nations and Japanese investor behaviour and are also more alert and quick to react to domestic news JBRI with 12 years' experience is Japan's largest agency The other two have been in business for two years Finance Ministry approval of yen commercial paper issues by Japanese residents which is expected soon will stimulate local agencies to grow quickly securities analysts said The Finance Ministry is encouraging more use of agencies by gradually abolishing limits on corporate debt creation In December it allowed non-residents holding at least an A-rating from one of the agencies to issue samurai shogun and euroyen bonds without first meeting the normal stringent financial criteria But local companies regardless of the rating obtained for a planned bond must meet the tough financial criteria set by commissioned banks and underwriters which includes minimum net asset requirements and capitalisation local agency managers said Commissioned banks are responsible for protecting bondholders and conducting principal and coupon payments Investors' risk in corporate default has been checked by the very system that is slowing the smooth growth of Japanese credit rating agencies the managers said The idea of rating in Japan has been woven into prerequisites for an issuer company to satisfy financial criteria JCRA's Watanabe said The Finance Ministry commissioned banks and securities houses agreed in January to lower the eligibility ceiling for companies wanting to issue non-collateral straight bonds An internationally comprehensive market system is needed to lure more overseas investors into the Japanese market JBRI's Yoshida said securities houses are thinking of allowing foreign brokerages to underwrite more Japanese government bonds from April securities managers said The average foreign brokerage now underwrites only around 007 pct of each such issue's volume they told The proposal is a response to overseas calls for Japan to liberalise its markets in the trend towards global trading Japanese brokerages are consistently heavy buyers of US Treasury issues <Nomura Securities International Inc> and <Daiwa Securities America Inc> were named primary dealers in US Government securities in December they noted Brokerages within the government bond-writing syndicate are now negotiating by how much foreign house subscriptions to government bonds should be raised the managers said The syndicate members agreed in April 1982 that 26 pct of 10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93 securities firms 17 of them foreign and 74 pct by banks The Finance Ministry later approved the arrangement Foreign brokers want to underwrite more government bonds due to their end-investor appeal <Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd> caught market attention by buying 45 billion yen of the 100 billion of government two-year notes auctioned on February 3 Salomon's operation was an attempt to demonstrate its commitment to the Japanese market in the hope of expanding its underwriting share of 10-year bonds securities sources said They said that to expand participation by foreigners the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share cut local brokerages' share or introduce auctions to the government bond primary market the sources said Bankers are likely to oppose losing any share and the Finance Ministry is unwilling to introduce auctions on the ground that it would slow smooth absorption of bonds in the secondary market securities manager said United States has openly attacked Japan's tight-fisted fiscal policy for the first time and warned Tokyo its promised economic package in April must be significant senior US Officials said In high-level talks last week the US Criticised Japan's overall fiscal policy as deflationary and argued that its fiscal position is not as dire as it says The criticism reflects a growing feeling among some US Policy-makers that Japan's tight fiscal policy is frustrating attempts to stimulate domestic demand and boost imports The US Attack represents a distinct shift by the conservative Reagan administration which until recently has been sympathetic to Tokyo's efforts to reduce the government role in the economy diplomats said Pointing out that Japan pledged in Paris last month to take action to boost demand a senior US Treasury official said the April package must be more than routine Japanese government bureaucrats have already said they do not expect the package to contain much more than a rehash of last April's measures That means accelerated public investment lower interest rates on government housing loans and measures to pass along the benefits of the strong yen to consumers none of which would have a major immediate economic impact Several Japanese officials agreed that the real obstacle to stimulating the economy is the fiscal policy pursued by the Finance Ministry and said they welcomed the shift in US Policy But they expressed concern that the move might backfire by fanning resentment against US Interference in domestic affairs Makoto Kuroda vice minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan would stimulate the economy not in response to US Criticism but to meet mounting pressure from Japanese businessmen The shift in US Policy is also causing some nervousness within the Reagan administration US Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis told reporters last week the US Does not necessarily want an increase in Japan's budget deficit There are many measures Japan could take to stimulate its economy he said The argument is not new and has been raised in the past by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development What is new is US Backing for the position At last week's talks Japanese officials said they argued Tokyo had been able to maintain a tight fiscal stance and boost the economy with funds from the giant postal savings system But the Finance Ministry was interested enough to ask for and receive the figures supporting the new US Position a senior US Official said Other western officials are not so sure They said it would take time to boost public investment much further as there are not that many projects in the pipeline Stepped-up capital spending would help domestic construction companies but it would not have much impact on imports they added customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price and Western traders have received even larger discounts Japanese traders involved in the transactions told NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas One company has bought 800000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price the sources said Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount they said Iran's discounted sales have not however managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets oil traders said Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe and reports that OPEC's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 158 mln barrels per day Firmer gas oil on the London futures and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels they said Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount the sources said It's just disguised cheating one Japanese trader said The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil It has purchased 15 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices or with part of the price related to processing arrangements 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade face slower economic growth and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987 the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 25 pct this year compared with a 28 pct growth forecast in December It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences and Japan hardest hit by currency appreciation this year The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 22 pct from 32 pct in December and to 23 pct from three pct

index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 184 pct drop The average mark/dollar rate is put at 180 marks this year and 170 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988 it said This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a

promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan or a tighter US Fsical policy it said It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy US Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss Thus far they have been willing the EIC said adding that if Japan was deterred from buying US bonds the dollar would collapse To contain such a currency crisis dollar interest rates would have to soar bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis it said On trade the EIU said prospects for 1987 look increasingly sick Import growth forecast in December at 45 pct is now seen slowing down to around 38 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 42 pct in 1988 it said The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 35 pct growth in 1987 against the 65 pct forecast in December the EIU said On the export side it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by US Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower more competitively-priced dollar It said in most of Europe and in Japan raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986 port operator <Hong Kong International Terminals Ltd>

he refrained from making any commitment to a new credit Ex-Im officials said In a 30-minute meeting Tanaka told Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro the bank would consider his country's request for a 300 mln dlr credit in the context of international cooperation the officials said They said this meant the Ex-Im Bank would grant the credit as part of a package with money from the International Monetary Fund and private banks Brazil has resisted going to the IMF for help because it fears that the Fund will ask for changes in its economic policies that will throw it into recession Brazil first requested the 300 mln dlr credit last November to help it develop the sale and generation of electric power Funaro renewed the request today 24 nations of the Organisation for

agreed to buy 18 billion dlrs worth of US goods during his two-week buying trip to the United States Rah said most of the purchases represented shifts from Japanese firms to US firms as part of South Korea's effort to reduce its seven billion dlr trade surplus with the United States South Korea has a five billion dlr trade deficit with Japan crushers bought 5000 to 7000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business over the weekend for April shipment trade sources said Japanese crushers continue to concentrate on rapeseed purchases since it converts to a higher percentage of oil than other oilseeds they said A glut of feed meals makes other oilseeds such as soybeans less desirable because they would add to already large meal stocks authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the US bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28 This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the US Treasury The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan's State of the Union message and was in a manner consistent with the joint statement made by US Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations At that meeting the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred But on January 28 the dollar closed at 15150/60 yen after dipping as low as 15040 yen earlier in the session It had closed at 15105/15 yen the previous day The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 14998 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 17675 marks on January 28 It ended that day at 17820/30 marks The Fed noted that after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar During the final days of January pressure on the dollar subsided Reports of the US-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters the Fed said Moreover doubts had developed about the course of US interest rates The dollar's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 18320 marks and 15370 yen According to the Fed's trade-weighted index it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period The dollar had risen as high as 208 marks and 165 yen in early November The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7 1985 when it bought a total of 1022 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord has contributed to the stability of exchange rates Miyazawa told a press conference the agreement reached last month in Paris by six major industrial nations to cooperate in bringing about currency stability has prevented speculative concerns from being active in money centres The decision in Paris is being understood by the market he said The yen-dollar exchange rate has been moving in a narrow range since finance ministers of Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany reached the accord arrested two Polish citizens for trying to steal Japanese computer technology local media reports said today The reports said the two had worked at a computer-related company in Tokyo and visited Japanese computer makers several times after coming to Japan on tourist visas last October One report said they were computer specialists at a Polish technology institute and that the company they worked for was managed by a naturalised Japanese from Poland who was a graduate of the institute Police officials declined to comment on the reports Finance Ministry auctioned 1000 billion yen worth of tankoku six month debt-financing paper to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19 a spokesman said The last tankoku auction on February 12 produced a record low yield of 3383 pct reflecting expectation of a half point cut in Japan's discount rate he said In the previous auction for 1000 billion yen four major Japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional investors securities managers said Securities managers said they expect the auction to go well again this time as securities houses will try to expand their inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from institutional investors Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku short-term interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for funds ahead of the March 31 financial year-end they said The Bank of Japan has been trying to dampen money market rates to make the latest discount rate cut effective but so far in vain dealers said The auction results will be announced tomorrow Ltd <ITSUT> may assemble computers in Oregon for sale in the United States under the Fujitsu brand name a company spokesman said He said the rising value of the yen against the dollar has virtually erased the wage differential between the two countries and Fujitsu would like to make the medium-size multi-functional business computers in the United States The Oregon plant owned by Fujitsu subsidiary <Fujitsu America Inc> now makes magnetic computer discs and will soon make printers Fujitsu Ltd also has a licensing agreement to make Amdahl Corp <AMH> computers for sale in the US microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a US-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips industry analysts said But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) which is pressuring the firms can successfully battle market forces and whether the US Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space they said US Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact the analysts said MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe Last month MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan market analysts said US Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts several analysts said Last week NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands said David Keller analyst at James Capel and Co Once NEC cuts production it means they all have Still pressures remain to keep production high Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for US Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact The best way to lower cost is to produce more said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions some industry officials said It's like tax avoidance schemes said Steve Donovan head of MMI Japan KK As soon as you close one route another opens MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance It's getting to be like communism said one But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses Bache's Wolffe said MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips but US Industry officials said response has been mixed at best There has been some change but it's not across the board said one US Spokesman The companies have a varying degree of urgency The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled US Industry remains in doubt analysts added Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips where Japan now leads analysts said Whether US Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips or interested in doing so also remains unclear they said Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new US Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing Even in the thorny area of access much depends on US Commitment as well as on Japanese openness some said The SIA (US Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't even have an office here a source close to the industry said You could question just how committed they are In addition some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea (South) Korea's gaining market share said one analyst They're the real winners from the agreement Finance Ministry said its auction yesterday of 1000 billion yen of tankoku six-month debt financing paper produced a record low average yield of 3246 pct on aggressive bidding from securities houses The tankoku mature on September 21 1987 The previous record low was 3383 pct at the last auction on February 12 One of four major Japanese securities house bought 395 pct of the total 10211 billion yen in bids accepted ministry sources said Securities houses bid aggressively as big retail accounts such as tokkin special money trust and trust funds have been showing strong interest in tankoku on increasing demand for short-term fund management securities house managers said The yield for tankoku issued on a discount basis is one point below the 426/12 pct interest rates for six-month certificates of deposit today In the previous auction for 1000 billion yen the four majors took 92 pct of the issue to increase their tankoku inventory the managers said Bids totalled 19758 billion yen The average price was 9836 to give a yield of 3246 pct and lowest was 9833 giving 3314 pct the Ministry said of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy he told a press conference His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets Conflicting economic indicators from the US Have also been dampening market activity he added crushers are likely to buy at least 200000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and another 100000 to 200000 if quality and shipping conditions are good against 128089 tonnes in 1986 trade sources said A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31000 tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment they said Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a bushel cheaper than US Origin due to the bumper harvest it is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their buying volume one source said Brazilian beans are available to Japan for shipment from May to July Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd> has reached agreement with <Lombard North Central Plc> of the UK To build plants and boost the local content in Nissan's UK Produced cars to 60 pct in 1988 from 40 to 50 pct the Nissan Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> said The agreement will allow the cars to be designated as domestically manufactured rather than imported vehicles Nissan said The agreement was reached through negotiations with the British government and the European Community (EC) after they threatened to impose duties on imports According to the 230 mln stg contract Lombard North Central an affiliate of National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBLL> will build and lease plants for engine assembly body panel pressing and resin moulding by 1988 They will be near the existing Nissan plant in Sunderland in north-east England Nissan said The Sunderland plant currently produces 24000 Bluebird cars annually for the British market Nissan hopes to begin UK Exports to Europe in 1991 after building an engine machining plant which would boost output to 100000 units a year and local content to above 80 pct in accordance with EC requests the spokesman said crushers starting to buy US Soybeans for April shipment have recently made purchases of some 48000 tonnes trade sources said The sources said they could not estimate the total volume to be purchased for April shipping because Japan's crushing program for April and June is unclear They had predicted earlier that crushers' April shipment US Bean purchases would drop to 260000 to 270000 from the monthly average of 300000 to 330000 tonnes due to low soybean meal prices Agency of Natural Resources and Energy said it will begin experiments with Thailand at the end of March to start commercial production

the year was estimated at 17 to 18 billion yen down 20 to 24 pct from a year earlier he said Takeuchi said sales are expected to fall 40 pct to 1700 billion yen for the fifth consecutive year-on-year drop This year's fall was due to lower selling prices for end-users which more than offset the yen's appreciation The company will retain six yen dividend for 1986/87 Steel Corp <NSTCT> and <Inland Steel Co> of the US Are negotiating to set up a joint steel venture in Indiana a Nippon Steel spokesman said declining to give more details Several local newspapers reported the joint venture would be

(EC) following an unofficial directive from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) automobile industry sources said Some sources said exports to the EC this year are likely to be at most unchanged from last year's 110 mln units and may even fall due to an anticipated slackening of EC economic growth and increasing trade friction Last week MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda said the ministry had asked car makers to exercise prudence in exporting to Europe Japanese car makers boosted exports to the EC in January to build up depleted vehicle inventories industry sources said Japan's vehicle exports to Europe in January rose 38 pct from a year earlier to 174133 units In December exports fell 704 pct year-on-year as makers curbed shipments

aide who declined to be identified said at a private meeting Nakasone's power in office does not necessarily terminate at the end of his term in October It depends on when (the) seven tax reform bills get parliamentary approval Nakasone vowed yesterday to press on with his plan despite Sunday's unexpected Upper House by-election defeat of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in a conservative stronghold The socialist winner backed by other opposition parties had campaigned against a controversial five pct value added sales tax the main plank of the reform plans The aide dismissed the possibility of any amendment of the sales tax on the grounds the opposition parties were demanding nothing but retraction of the tax They have been refusing to discuss a draft budget for the 1987 fiscal year starting on April 1 which includes the tax plans They have been resorting to an on-off boycott of parliament since February 4 If I were Nakasone I would close the current regular parliamentary session on May 27 as scheduled attend the Venice summit of industrial democracies in June and open an extraordinary session to discuss the tax plans the aide said Under law a regular session can be extended only once while an extraordinary session can be extended twiceThe other option would be to extend the current session he said The opposition parties will surely present a no-confidence motion against the Nakasone Cabinet at one stage or another One scenario then will be to reject the motion opening up the way for tax reform Another scenario is the resignation of the Nakasone Cabinet en masse A third scenario is a dissolution of the Lower House for a snap general election the aide said That is only possible if the 200 opposition members resign from the 512-seat Lower House necessitating by-elections The LDP now has 304 seats in the Lower House after its landslide victory in general elections last July There are five independents and three vacancies The LDP which will put up candidates will certainly inflate their seats but at the expense of fierce media criticism the aide said He said he expected the proposed sales tax to have little effect on local elections to be held on April 12 and 26 About 2600 elections will be held in all but three of the nation's 47 prefectures including 13 gubernatorial elections Candidates running in prefectural assemblies will all oppose the sales tax irrespective of their party tickets Possible effects if any will be on gubernatorial elections in Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido and Fukuoka in

said The accord on the loan for Indonesia's 21 development projects was signed by the visiting Indonesian Finance Minister Radius Prawiro and Ex-Im President Takashi Tanaka the spokesman said The loan will be the bank's first untied loan to an Asian country in co-financing with the World Bank but it will not be tied to purchase of Japanese goods or services he said of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy he told a press conference His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets Conflicting economic indicators from the US Have also been dampening market activity he added Finance Ministry said its auction yesterday of 1000 billion yen of tankoku six-month debt financing paper produced a record low average yield of 3246 pct on aggressive bidding from securities houses The tankoku mature on September 21 1987 The previous record low was 3383 pct at the last auction on February 12 One of four major Japanese securities house bought 395 pct of the total 10211 billion yen in bids accepted ministry sources said Securities houses bid aggressively as big retail accounts such as tokkin special money trust and trust funds have been showing strong interest in tankoku on increasing demand for short-term fund management securities house managers said The yield for tankoku issued on a discount basis is one point below the 426/12 pct interest rates for six-month certificates of deposit today In the previous auction for 1000 billion yen the four majors took 92 pct of the issue to increase their tankoku inventory the managers said Bids totalled 19758 billion yen The average price was 9836 to give a yield of 3246 pct and lowest was 9833 giving 3314 pct the Ministry said cannot bear a further rise of the yen Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden he told reporters The minister said he wants to tell US Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax If the boycott is lifted tomorrow Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government's 1987/88 budget Japanese officials said Kuranari said both the US And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm unemotional manner But he added If the issue of rice is to be raisedI would mention the feelings of the Japanese people Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to US Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive

Trade Bank has signed with a group of Japanese banks a 40 billion Euroyen equivalent loan which is the largest syndicated loan denominated in euroyen for a European borrower Bank of Tokyo Ltd said as one of the lead managers The financing is for seven years and provides the borrower with the option to borrow in other currencies Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd was the other lead manager and nine Japanese banks joined the financing The syndication of the deal was designed to enhance the Foreign Trade Bank's relationship with Japanese financial institutions Bank of Tokyo said The financing marked the first trip to the international capital markets for the borrower since 1985 The loan has a six year grace period and interest is at 1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate for the first two

Austin a design engineering and construction firm said in a statement that it and Kawasaki would bid for support facility work worth 200-250 mln dlrs The Kansai project is to cost about eight billion dls US officials have complained to Japan that American firms are being squeezed out of work on Kansai and threatened to restrict Japanese construction firms in the United States if Kansai is not opened to US companies Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt He said in an interview with that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 445 billion dlr foreign debt Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 45 billion dlrs against a 1985 deficit of 900 mln dlrs Asked if South Korea would drop its trade barriers once its foreign debt was substantially reduced he said yes I think so Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy US products valued at 18 billion dlrs About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen He said in the interview the US purchases were to reduce his country's 71 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 56 billion dlr shortfall with Japan Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the US dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy US goods than Japanese goods He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation Rha said I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions But he added the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons Speaking of his own country he said We have made a lot of concessions already He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs Asked if South Korea would retaliate against US goods if Congress closed US markets to its products he said at this moment we have no thought of retaliation South Korea is a major exporter to the United States of textiles and apparel and electronic goods such as television sets video cassette records and personal computers Its puchases from the United States include electronic testing equipment and grains and cotton The trade mission's purchases here included three Boeing passenger planes for 400 mln dlrs four McDonnell Douglas planes for 300 mln dlrs; and machinery worth 725 mln dlrs recent purchase of 15 mln tonnes of US corn by Japan and 600000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing the US Agriculture Department said In its World Production and Trade Report the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn With these corn purchases Japan is committed to buying 77 mln tonnes of US corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug) nearly 400000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 25 mln tonnes up 15 mln compared to last year it said today called on Japan to increase foreign imports or risk the rise of protectionism and the harm it would bring to it and other trading nations British Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon said Japan must heed a report issued by a Japanese government advisory body in December calling for faster domestic demand to help cut its trade surplus and restructure its economy I recognise that the strong yen has brought problems to Japan's domestic economy he told a group of Japanese businessmen in London But these short term difficulties should not be allowed to deflect Japan from the fundamental reforms necessary he said It is not just a domestic issue for Japan If import propensity does not expand very soon there is a real risk from protectionist lobbies particularly in the US With whom Japan has so massive a surplus he said They may well succeed in securing action by governments which would be highly injurious to trading nations like Japan and the UK Channon said there had been substantial growth in the volume of trade between Japan and Britain amounting to 62 billion sterling (98 billion dlrs) last year But he added: Regrettably too much of it was in one direction with the Japanese selling us 37 billion sterling (58 billion dlrs) more than we sold them has relaxed its limit on the establishment of securities company outlets in order to service a growing number of individual investors the Finance Ministry said Japanese securities companies can now set up as many as 21 new outlets in the two years before March 31 1989 against the previous maximum of 13 The rules apply to outlets in department stores supermarkets and other locations convenient for individuals Foreign securities firms are not affected by the ruling it said efforts to redirect Japan's export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> (MHI) which began making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130 years ago is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products everyone will buy them MHI president Yotaro Iida said Although two of MHI's main businesses shipbuilding and power plant construction have been hit hard by the yen's 40 pct rise against the dollar the company has no plans to abandon them Iida told in an interview Its other big activity aircraft component manufacture has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year We have made the utmost efforts among the world's manufacturers to improve productivity he said You may be surprised if you come to see our plants The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern with robots and computers Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors The company has slashed its workforce to 47000 from 86000 in 1976 Despite its cost-cutting MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31 from 1985/86's record 5014 billion And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMTT> for 49 billion yen Iida is optimistic about the future however He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 259 pct in the half-year ended last September from 35 to 36 pct five years ago China is the most promising market although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency Iida said But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future In shipping MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport Shipbuilders Association officials told MHI is the world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity Domestically MHI is involved in 12 national projects including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles although all of these have been built under licence from US Firms MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a US Plane either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16 to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the US It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with US Makers as Japan is supported by the US Defence umbrella Iida said MHI also plans to cooperate with the US In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage he said The US Has been seeking Japan's technological support In fiscal 1985/86 aircraft accounted for 171 pct of MHI's sales shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 279 pct Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct As for the remaining 30 pct Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods but he declined to specify which products By the end of this year you may find our brand name on your daily products although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business he said corporate bankruptcies in February fell 108 pct from January to 1071 cases and total debts dropped 494 pct to 14940 billion yen the Tokyo Commerce and Industry Research Co said February bankruptcies fell 149 pct from a year earlier the 26th straight monthly decline and debts fell 543 pct The lower number of bankruptcies in February reflected a relaxation of money market conditions and reduced bill settlements due to fewer operating days it said Bankruptcies caused by the strength of the yen against the dollar totalled 69 or 64 pct of those in February with debts of 2552 billion yen the research firm said This compared with 64 with debts of 12559 billion yen in January it said Currency-linked bankruptcies since November 1985 when the dollar's depreciation against the yen began to affect Japanese export-linked firms totalled 772 with cumulative debts of 66053 billion yen it said The value of the yen against the dollar rose to an average 15349 yen per dollar in February from 18462 a year earlier Bankruptcies usually decline in the first quarter of the year due to fewer operating days and for seasonal reasons Bankruptcies are expected to increase in the quarter starting April 1 due to expectations of slow consumer spending low wage increases for the 1987/88 fiscal year which starts in April and slow capital spending by manufacturers the company said Bankrupcties among export-linked subcontractors will rise due to a recent shift by major manufacturers to overseas production it added Sekiyukagaku KK> and <Exxon Chemical Co> a petrochemical division of Exxon Corp <XON> said they agreed to accelerate a study to set up an equally-owned joint venture to make waterwhite resin in Japan Details of the venture to be based on Exxon Chemical technology will be set later the companies said Waterwhite resins are widely used in adhesive applications for baby nappies medical tapes and other bonding agents Tonen is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toa Nenryo Kogyo KK <TNENT> which is owned 25 pct by Exxon Corp Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major US Computer and semiconductor maker US Officials said yesterday The officials told reporters Baldrige had serious concerns on national security grounds about the sale of Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> unit <Fairchild Semiconductor Inc> to Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> The officials said the sale could leave the United States overly dependent on a foreign company for equipment used in advanced missiles aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering The US Officials added the sale would also worsen the strained relations between the two countries stemming from the huge Japanese trade surplus The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks they said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments or companies Computers made by US Manufacturers are widely used in the world but Tokyo told US Negotiators recently it prefers local manufacturers and would not buy US Supercomputers Tokyo Stock Exchange said in a statement it is considering reducing brokerage fees on yen convertible bonds The cut would be in response to a planned increase in securities transaction tax to 26 yen per 10000 yen from 45 as part of the government's proposed tax reform bills securities house managers said Under the current system investors must also pay 06 pct of face value as brokerage fee to securities houses for transactions involving principal over 30 mln yen The exchange's draft revision sets brokerage fee percentage rates in inverse proportion to the size of amounts transacted market sources said Details of rates on transactions under 30 mln yen have yet to be worked out an exchange spokesman said The news had little immediate impact on the convertible bond market because participants are unsure when the new rates will be introduced and because the timing of parliamentary approval of the tax reform bills is uncertain due to opposition to them securities dealers said overseas production in yen terms of Japanese firms should rise 26 pct in 1987/88 ending March after a four pct fall in 1986/87 a Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey said It attributed the rise to companies moving production overseas to avoid losses due to the strong yen The survey covered 122 major firms in 17 sectors The survey called for bold moves to stimulate domestic demand to achieve the government's goal of 35 pct gross national product growth in 1987/88 A package of economic measures to boost the economy is expected next month The survey said Japanese car output in the United States and Canada would jump to two mln vehicles in fiscal 1990 from 617000 in 1986 and worldwide electronic appliance output would rise 317 pct Domestic unemployment is likely to reach four pct or about 25 mln jobless in fiscal 1990 from three pct now if current trends continue Recruitment in the car industry is expected to fall by 35 pct in 1987/88 and by 40 pct in the electronics sector The steel industry plans to cut its 150000 workforce by 27 pct by the end of 1990/91 and the shipbuilding coal and non-ferrous metal industries all plan big cuts in 1987/88 Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 200 billion yen of financing bills under a 50-day repurchase agreement maturing on May 2 to help absorb a projected money market surplus due largely to distribution of local allocation tax ahead of the March 31 fiscal year-end money traders said The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39496 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate for two-month commercial bills and the 446/37 pct yield today on two-month certificates of deposit The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 1500 billion yen coffee exporters are preparing for a period of depressed prices while urging their government to lobby for a resolution of the deadlocked issue of export quotas the chairman of the Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters (AICE) told Dharyono Kertosastro said in an interview that Indonesia the world's third largest producer is trimming costs and improving its marketing while seeking a compromise on quotas But as long as Brazil sticks to its hardline position we can never bridge the gap Dharyono said Indonesia was one of a group of eight producing countries along with Costa Rica the Dominican Republic Ecuador Honduras India Papua New Guinea and Peru which proposed a new quota system at last month's failed International Coffee Organistion (ICO) talks in London Brazil which would have had its quota reduced under the Group of Eight scheme blocked the proposal AICE officials are now hoping Colombia can use its contacts with Brazil to suggest a compromise Edward Muda an AICE official who attended the ICO negotiations said Latin American members of the Group of Eight were in contact with Colombia the world's second largest producer but gave no details Colombia has shown interest because they will gain from a compromise Without one they will suffer if the present market stays like it is Muda said He said Indonesia was in contact with consumers such as the US Japan the Netherlands West Germany and Canada ahead of an ICO executive board meeting scheduled for April 1 Dharyono said the AICE will send delegations to the US And Japan to brief Indonesian embassy officials there and press them to present Indonesia's case more firmly He urged the Indonesian government to do more to help the country's coffee traders through the ICO negotiations Muda said the Group of Eight had some common ground with the big consumers because they agreed on the need for basing quotas on what he termed realistic criteria The breakaway group believes the old quota system which gives Brazil a 30 pct share of the quota exports does not reflect up-to-date supply and demand trends Brazil has stuck rigidly to its insistence that the old system be applied Export quotas were suspended in February 1986 when market prices surged because of the failure of the Brazilian crop Although prices have long since come down to a point where export controls could be reintroduced producers and consumers at the 75-member ICO have not been able to agree on new guidelines Brazil and the US The largest consumer are both refusing to alter their positions Dharyono said if new quotas are not agreed he believed Indonesia was well placed to survive low prices Indonesian farmers are trimming production costs and the AICE is improving its marketing system Dharyono said Indonesia's coffee output in 1986/87 ending September 30 is expected to stagnate or fall slightly from last year's level of 360000 tonnes he said He said stocks at 90000 tonnes were about average for the time of year corporate earnings will rise 89 pct in fiscal 1987/88 for the first year-on-year increase in three years partly because of the yen's stable exchange rate the Nomura research institute said Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 19 pct in the year which starts April 1 the research arm of Nomura Securities Co said in a statement Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the current fiscal year with sales forecast to drop 14 pct The forecast assumes an average rate of 1485 yen to the dollar in 1987/88 compared with 160 yen in the current year Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation such as cutting production costs are expected to bear fruit next fiscal year the institute said The economy should also benefit from pump-priming expected from the government and a halt in rising prices of manufactured goods it said Recurrent profits of manufacturing industries are projected to rise 296 pct next fiscal year against an estimated 401 pct fall in the current year Non-manufacturing sector profits will decline 45 pct in 1987/88 against an estimated 22 pct rise in the current year it said is ready to discuss bank regulation and capital adequacy with western monetary authorities but cannot say when or how joint rules can be agreed Japanese vice-minister of finance for international affairs Toyoo Gyohten said He told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets that Japan viewed a January outline agreement between the Bank of England and US Regulatory authorities as significant The accord setting joint rules on capital adequacy was criticised in financial markets for excluding Japan thus putting US And UK Banks at a disadvantage to Japanese banks I am pleased to say that we are prepared to work with British and American regulators Gyohten said He added that preliminary contacts had already been made in the margin of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basle where central bank governors of western nations meet every month But proper negotiations were still some way off We have to start learning about the different situations in each country before we can start working towards joint rules he said I can't predict when or how we will reach conclusions he added Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow 200 billion yen of financing bills under a 50-day repurchase agreement maturing on May 2 to help absorb a projected money market surplus due largely to distribution of local allocation tax ahead of the March 31 fiscal year-end money traders said The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39496 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate for two-month commercial bills and the 446/37 pct yield today on two-month certificates of deposit The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 1500 billion yen has relaxed its limit on the establishment of securities company outlets in order to service a growing number of individual investors the Finance Ministry said Japanese securities companies can now set up as many as 21 new outlets in the two years before March 31 1989 against the previous maximum of 13 The rules apply to outlets in department stores supermarkets and other locations convenient for individuals Foreign securities firms are not affected by the ruling it said Japanese real estate company said it will launch a campaign to sell land in US Farming areas to rich Japanese Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2200 acres of land in Illinois California Florida and Indiana from early April to gauge response It set up International Farm Corp of America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation American farmers would continue as working tenants and part of the profits from harvests of rice corn soybean and oranges would go to the Japanese investors as rental Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told sales were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use Two years ago I began to seek my own farmland in Japan said Isao Nakamura president of Higashi Nippon However sale of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government so I began to look for the land in the US to make my dream to own farm land come true Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the US To sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face difficulties due to the recession in US Agriculture Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major US supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons US officials said The officials who asked not to be named said yesterday that Baldrige has serious concerns about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp to Fujitsu Ltd another major electronics firm The officials told that if the sale went through it could leave the US military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering In addition they said the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the US and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks they said Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other US manufacturers are widely used throughout the world but none have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese government-run agencies and universities worst may be just about over for Japan's battered economy but economists said they do not expect a vigorous recovery anytime soon Japanese bank economists polled by said the economy's 18 month-old slowdown is likely to end in the first half of this year helped by rising exports stepped-up government spending and falling prices The economy will bottom out in the middle of the year said Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi agreed It (the bottom) is in the offing he said But he added that the recovery will be slow Growth in the fiscal year beginning next month will only pick-up 22 pct from two pct in the current year he said Signs that the economy has just about weathered the worst are increasing The volume of exports in the first two months of the year rose slightly on a year-on-year basis after declining toward the end of last year Although this may be due to extraordinary factors such as a sharp rise in car exports to rebuild depleted European stocks several economists said it could mark the beginning of a recovery Industrial production fell 07 pct in January much smaller than expected and is forecast by the government to rise 03 pct in February and 26 pct in March A Bank of Japan survey released last week showed that the decline in Japanese corporate earnings may be nearing its end And the Paris currency accord last month has fostered hopes the rapid yen rise has come to the end they said Six nations - the UK Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - pledged in Paris last month to stabilise currencies around current levels The yen's 40 pct climb against the dollar over the last two years has hit the export-driven economy hard by forcing its companies to raise prices and lose sales in the US Market The important thing is the exchange rate Taketomi said If it stabilises firms will grow more confident and raise investment in plant and equipment although there are no signs of that yet economists said A stable yen would also help exporters regain some of their competitive edge just as the US economy may be starting to recover economists said Domestically the economy may get a boost from some loosening of the government's tight fiscal policy said Haruo Muto manager of national economics at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd The next reading of the economy's health should come early next week with the release of gnp figures for the last quarter 1986 Most private economists expect a rise of about 05 pct from the previous quarter In the third quarter GNP rose 06 pct But a senior government official said the fourth quarter figures could surprise by showing a rise of more than one point quarter-on-quarter But he added that would be a statistical aberration and not a significant shift in economic activity To maintain year-on-year growth of around 25 pct the economy would have had to rise about 12 pct in the fourth quarter as the final quarter of 1985 was strong The rise in the fourth quarter of 1985 was probably a statistical anomaly that was repeated in the final months of 1986 the official said Economists said the fourth quarter figures were also distorted by the government's sale of gold coins in the second half of 1986 Because the coins were classified as legal tender their purchase did not show up in the statistics on consumer expenditure Consumer spending also tailed off in December because of bad weather and smaller-than-normal end-year bonuses they said As the government had to buy back some of the coins from retailers because they were unsold the government's contribution to the economy in the fourth quarter may have been boosted economists said Taketomi said it may have received a further boost from government buying of farm products as the domestic crop last year was good The senior government official said the fourth quarter performance of the domestic sector was probably worse than generally expected while that of the external sector was better Japanese companies have decided not to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels industry sources said They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai traded yesterday at 1650 dlrs a barrel compared to its official price of 1742 dlrs Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for Iranian crude oil for the second quarter the sources said The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a total of about 185000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude under term contracts but only one firm has agreed to lift in the second quarter It is lifting just 10000 to 15000 bpd They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts on cargoes loading in April but the likelihood of discounts depended largely on the levels of spot prices If the spot price of Dubai goes above 1730 dlrs we would probably buy Iranian crude at the official price one Japanese refiner said We don't intend to put pressure on them he added Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are considerably lower oil traders said They said if spot prices move higher there will be no problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after finding no buyers at official prices in March The problem is likely to recur in April adding to that country's surplus The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from OPEC's December production agreement while agreeing to the fixed prices But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to its first-half 1987 ceiling of 158 mln bpd supply and demand would be balanced by the end of the second quarter They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure based on a reference price of 18 dlrs spot price fluctuations should be limited to a 1650 to 1720 dlrs range for Dubai and a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend One Japanese refiner said At the moment there's a lot of pressure on OPEC particularly on Qatar But if they hold out there will be no problem and I'm beginning to trust their ability Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman told a news conference in Lagos yesterday Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks of both crude oil and refined products reducing them to levels well below this time last year He said consumers would soon return to the market in search of crude A Japanese refiner said The European and US Markets are beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to US exporters when he visits that country next month In an interview with Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on US beef and citrus exports Lyng who plans to be in Japan April 14-27 said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market he said The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the US would request We've got none of it now If we got one per cent of it it would be a big improvement he said Last year the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the US rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions However the US said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to US rice exports Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas but that his visit may be a forerunner in a general way to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988 He said however that the US will ask for a definite liberalization of those items (beef and citrus) When you translate 'liberalization' into Japanese it means do away with the quota Electronics Corp asked the US Supreme Court to consider its anti-dumping case against Japanese television manufacturers In a complex case that dates to 1974 Zenith has charged a group of Japanese companies with violations of US antitrust and anti-dumping laws The US electronics company today said it asked the high court to review a 1986 lower court ruling that dismissed both the antitrust and anti-dumping portions of the case crushers bought 8000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for April shipment trade sources said Fund Inc said its board would recommend at its April 23 stockholders meeting that the Fund be converted to a no-load open-end fund If approved the Fund said a redemption fee of one pct of net asset value will be imposed on redemptions for a period of time not to exceed six months after open-ending It said such a redemption fee is designed to cover trasaction costs related to early redemptions and will remain in the assets of the Fund It said Shearson Lehman Brothers is serving as its financial advisor In a prepared statement Jonathan Mason Japan Fund's chairman said open-ending which is timely given the expansion of the Japanese stock markets particularly in the last few years will eliminate the discount from net asset value and will afford investors the continuing opportunity for investment in Japan through the Japan Fund Japan Fund said it proposed the conversion to an open-end fund after rejecting a takeover offer of about 525 mln dlrs from an investment group led by T Boone Pickens III son of the Texas oilman The investor group whose other members include <Sterling Grace Capital Fund LP> and <Anglo American Security Fund LP> could not be reached tonight for comment When it made its takeover offer on March 3 the group said it owned 14 mln shares or about 49 pct of the fund's outstanding stock Asked to comment on the rejection of the investor group's offer a Japan Fund spokeswoman said The board decided that an open-end fund was preferable The spokeswoman Davia B Temin said no other comments would be made on the offer She also declined to provide details on other options Japan Fund said previously that it would consider along with the takeover bid Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he thinks exchange rates will remain stable due to the currency accord reached in Paris last month by six major industrialised nations but he did not say for how long The dollar has hovered around 153 yen since the six agreed to cooperate to bring about currency stability Asked to comment on remarks by some US Officials calling for a further decline of the dollar Miyazawa said only the US President and the US Treasury Secretary can make official statements about exchange rates Finance Ministry will institute a study to consider changing the corporate disclosure rules to provide more information for investors a ministry official said The study will look at whether companies should include data on profits for separate divisions products and overseas regions in corporate earnings statements the official said At present companies give such breakdowns for sales only He said no time limit has been set for the study Japanese businessman Noboyuki Wakaoji is alive and well and may soon be released Cardinal Jaime Sin the archbishop of Manila said Wakaoji head of the Philippines branch of Mitsui and Co Ltd is being visited on a daily basis by a senior priest Sin told reporters at a briefing He refused to reveal Wakaoji's whereabouts The businessman was kidnapped last November and his captors have demanded a five mln dlr ransom from Mitsui Agriculture Ministry said it set Japan's beef import quota for the six months from April 1 at 93000 tonnes up from 83000 in the second half of 1986/87 and 85000 a year earlier Under an agreement with the US And Australia Japan has been increasing imports by 9000 tonnes a year from March 31 1985 to reach a projected 177000 tonnes in the year to March 31 1988 denied breaking a pact with the US On semiconductor trade but said prices set out in the pact were too high and acknowledged difficulties in implementing the accord We are faithfully abiding by the  Agreement but of course there are some problems a spokesman for the International Trade and Industry Ministry told He said the high semiconductor prices recommended by the agreement were leaving Japanese manufacturers piling up stocks of unsellable products We are aiming to reduce production in Japan but of course this takes time he said The spokesman said some Japanese companies were selling chips in Europe and Asia below stipulated prices but added: It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem The eight month old pact aims to stop Japan selling large quantities of chips at knock-down prices to the United States and other countries and to increase US Semiconductor sales in Japan The US Senate Finance Committee this week called on President Reagan in a non-binding resolution to retaliate against Japan for violating the agreement Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura told a parliamentary session Japan's small- and medium-sized enterprises are seriously suffering from the yen's rise and can only stand levels around 170 yen He also said he still believes a dollar exchange rate level plus or minus 10 yen from 170 yen would be within levels agreed upon last month in Paris by six major industrial nations Finance ministers of Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed on February 22 to cooperate in stabilizing exchange rates around the current levels The dollar had closed here at 15377 yen on February 20 shipbuilders have applied to the state's Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to restrict tonnage built to about half of total capacity for the year starting April 1 officials of the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said Under the plan 33 yards capable of building ships of more than 10000 gross tons will curtail operations to three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) a year against capacity of about six mln CGRT The Transport Ministry estimates new orders at 33 mln CGRT in the year to March 1988 and 31 mln the following year The industry has curtailed production due to oversupply nearly every year since 1977/78 under cartel or Transport Ministry guidelines The latest guidelines call for a ceiling of four mln CGRT in the year to March 31 The cartels self-imposed and self-regulated are not legally binding but industry finds it in its own interest to stick to them The slowdown in orders has been caused by the strong yen and a protracted worldwide shipbuilding slump global links between futures markets mean that the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) must add Chicago and London to its list of rivals banking sources said When SIMEX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) introduced US Treasury bond futures last autumn the sources expected to see fierce rivalry between the two exchanges ending with only one winner in Asia But surprisingly the challenges now appear to be coming from the other side of the world they said The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will introduce night trading in its US Treasury bond contract on April 30 which could clash with SIMEX morning activity banking sources said The CBOT had planned to introduce night trading on April 2 but postponed the move to allow participants time to prepare The London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a US Treasury bond contract that can be offset on the CBOT they said Such a LIFFE contract is expected later this year LIFFE liquidity could be higher than at the SIMEX where average daily volume in Treasury bonds dropped to 165 in February from 1286 last October when the bonds were first introduced The contracts were set up to attract hedging from the rapidly growing underlying cash market in US Treasury bonds in Toyko but interest has waned as that market has grown more stable traders said Restrictions on investments by Japanese residents have also inhibited the growth of the futures contracts in both Singapore and Sydney the banking sources said Nevertheless all 450 seats on SIMEX are now taken with the last trading at 55000 dlrs against the initial price of 50000 dlrs The current bid is 55500 dlrs but offers at 65000 show that confidence in SIMEX remains said Michael Killian general manager of Chase Manhattan Futures Corp Killian a SIMEX board member said the CBOT night session might raise arbitrage opportunities and SIMEX would benefit from a local stock exchange index contract planned for the end of 1987 SIMEX also became more competitive after this month's budget eliminated withholding tax on interest earned on futures margin deposits Banking sources said the tax change would boost SIMEX trading by non-bank institutions and individuals and would benefit foreign firms and institutions While the Treasury bond contract has been somewhat disappointing other SIMEX contracts continue to expand Fong Yew Meng SIMEX assistant general manager told Volume in the SIMEX's Nikkei stock index based on the Tokyo stock market has risen to a daily average of more than 1000 contracts this month from 320 contracts last October helped by uncertainty during the recent bull run in Tokyo stocks Fong said Open interest in the Nikkei contract introduced last year reached a record 2697 on February 26 Killian said the Nikkei contract has considerable potential for expansion as overseas investors have been avoiding the contract because they currently see no need to hedge the rising cash market in Tokyo SIMEX is also enjoying record trading in other contracts In February total volume on the exchange reached a record 122819 contracts surpassing the previous monthly record of 116767 set in September Eurodollar volume reached a record 78546 contracts last month against 70306 in September SIMEX is likely to try to maintain its growth by moving into options soon but competition continues regionally as well as globally banking sources said The Sydney exchange plans to introduce by June a share index futures contract based on a composite of stocks on which equity options are traded which could generate more liquidity than the ordinary index banking sources said Local interest in the Sydney Treasury bond contract may also flare if the Sydney exchange establishes a three-way link with Chicago and London traders in Sydney said LIFFE is discussing such a link with the CBOT they said shr 53 yen vs 22 Net

making it easier for the government to issue commemorative coins a Finance Ministry official said The bill which must still be approved by parliament would take effect in April 1988 It would allow the government to issue 1000 5000 and 10000 yen coins without special legislation although higher-valued coins would still need a special law the official said At present it can only issue coins of 500 yen or less Finance Ministry has clarified regulations governing fund management satisfying overseas critics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn ministry officials and Western diplomats said They said double licensing has been dropped so a foreign fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well A foreign investment management company will be permitted to employ only one fund manager in Japan with another on standby in the home country Domestic companies must have two In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm is eligible to manage funds in Japan the ministry will take account of the amount of funds the parent company has under management a ministry official said This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the criteria for a licence he said without elaborating He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment management licences by the end of June Some 135 firms including some 15 foreign companies will probably be licensed under the new law passed late last year short-term effect of foreign exchange rate movements in correcting international trade imbalances appears to be waning and long-term efforts are required to cut Japan's chronic dependence on external demand the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report Japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain high in the near future the central bank said Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of resources and maintain the free trade system it added Foreign Ministry official dismissed arguments made by senior US Government officials seeking to block the sale of a US Microchip maker to a Japanese firm They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American Division told US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the sale of <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> US Officials said yesterday Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the US Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high technology equipment Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale US Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a powerful role in the US Market for supercomputers while Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to US Sales Takemoto said national security should not be an issue since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> does not include Fairchild's main defence-related division In addition Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make supercomputers Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated microchips used in supercomputers Fujitsu makes similar chips and supplies them to US Supercomputer makers they said Takemoto also dismissed US Fears that the proposed takeover would violate US Antitrust law saying the purchase would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the US Semiconductor market Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost pressure to block the purchase industry analysts said The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its domestic market to more US Supercomputer sales they said US Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese public sector is closed to US Supercomputer sales despite US Firms' technological lead in the field The United States believes Japan will only react when bullied and this is a bullying ploy Salomon Brothers Asia analyst Carole Ryavec said However the analysts said more is at stake than supercomputer sales as the US Fears it is losing its vital semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors The real issue is xenophobia in (the US) Silicon Valley said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co US-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding by the agreement problems remain in halting the sale of microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those set by the pact It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem he told Despite the furore Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with Schlumberger last year a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has refused to drop a proposed sales tax as debate on a draft budget for 1987 resumed after a nine-day opposition boycott I have no plan to withdraw the sales tax as I think it is the best policy (for Japan) Nakasone told the budget committee of the lower house of parliament Kyodo News Agency said a small group of members of Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party filed a complaint with their local headquarters calling for his expulsion from the party on the grounds he broke a campaign pledge by introducing the sales tax Nakasone admitted the tax was a major factor in an upper house by-election defeat for his party on Sunday The election was the first national-level poll since Nakasone presented his plan for overhauling Japan's tax system which has remained unaltered for the past 36 years The sales tax and the planned abolition of the tax-free saving system are designed to offset proposed income and corporate tax cuts agreed in talks with the US To amend its laws to allow more companies to engage in international value-added network telecommunications services a Post and Telecommunications Ministry official said Such services make communications between otherwise incompatible computers possible over telecommunications lines The official said firms registering as Special Type Two Telecommunications Firms which are those leasing lines from common carriers will be permitted to re-lease the lines to users and provide international services Steps will also be taken to assure fairness in negotiations between common carriers and firms seeking to lease lines the official said Since December 10 companies have registered as Special Type Two firms including two which have American Telephone and Telegraph Co <T> or McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> as major shareholders the official said Currently only <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> and <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> are allowed to operate international telecommunications services Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major industrial nations last month does not necessarily mean the yen should stay stable around current levels in the future The Paris agreement was aimed at stopping a further rapid fluctuation of exchange rates he said The accord stipulated that current rates reflect fundamentals of the six nations - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany securities houses have asked the Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of 10-year government bonds securities sources said Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses for 10-year bond auctions Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April Four US Banks are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they hold no more than 50 pct of the capital bankers said These firms are likely to join the syndicate which will increase the number of participants in the 10-year government bond primary market securities managers said Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the syndicate underwrites 007 pct of each issue they said In order to expand participation by foreigners the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share or introduce auctions to the primary market they said Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate now Fuji Bank Ltd to increase their share to 307 pct but banks oppose any cut in their 74 pct share bankers said personal savings grew 103 pct in 1986 from 1985 helped by a sharp increase in stock investments by individuals the Bank of Japan said Outstanding savings on December 31 1986 totalled 545303 billion yen Funds in investment trusts alone totalled 21918 billion yen up 374 pct from a year earlier The outstanding balance also included deposits at banks and post offices up 74 pct to 337867 billion yen savings in the form of insurance up 186 pct to 111431 billion corporate bond investments up 78 pct to 46867 billion and investments in trust banks up 41 pct to 27220 billion profits of Japan's major firms in the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier to 5654 billion yen against a 26 pct year-on-year rise in the preceding quarter the Finance Ministry said The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 225 pct profit increase in non-manufacturing industries supported by an 887 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in real estate according to a ministry survey Total sales of the 15308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen or more which responded to the poll fell one pct to 217217 billion yen against a 12 pct fall the previous quarter Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth quarter dropped 137 pct to 2394 billion yen against a 221 pct fall in the preceding quarter the ministry said Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell 39 pct to 8004 billion yen compared with a 14 percent fall the previoius quarter Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is heading for a recovery Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary session the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy Miyazawa said the Paris currency accord among six major industrial nations last month does not

Trade and Industry (MITI) said University and industry representatives will start discussions in April on basic research and possible applications Masatoshi Urashima MITI's director for development of future basic technology said Superconductors which conduct electricity with very low resistance could be used in computers semiconductors and high speed trains he said Urashima said recent discoveries of superconductive materials which do not need extremely low temperatures led to MITI's decision to coordinate research MITI's electric technology laboratory is currently researching energy efficiency

chronic dependence on external demand the Bank of Japan said in a monthly report Japan's trade surplus in nominal terms is likely to remain high in the near future the central bank said Fundamental adjustments will be needed as long as Japan hopes to benefit from a better international allocation of resources and maintain the free trade system it added Finance Ministry has clarified regulations governing fund management satisfying overseas critics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn ministry officials and Western diplomats said They said double licensing has been dropped so a foreign fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well A foreign investment management company will be permitted to employ only one fund manager in Japan with another on standby in the home country Domestic companies must have two In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm is eligible to manage funds in Japan the ministry will take account of the amount of funds the parent company has under management a ministry official said This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the criteria for a licence he said without elaborating He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment management licences by the end of June Some 135 firms including some 15 foreign companies will probably be licensed under the new law passed late last year securities houses have asked the Finance Ministry again to consider introducing auctions of 10-year government bonds securities sources said Finance Ministry officials declined comment but said the Ministry has been aware of growing calls from securities houses for 10-year bond auctions Japanese securities houses also may allow foreign brokers to underwrite more 10-year bonds from April Four US Banks are expected to receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate securities subsidiaries in Japan as long as they hold no more than 50 pct of the capital bankers said These firms are likely to join the syndicate which will increase the number of participants in the 10-year government bond primary market securities managers said Each of the 17 current foreign securities houses in the syndicate underwrites 007 pct of each issue they said In order to expand participation by foreigners the syndicate must either expand the securities industry's 26 pct share or introduce auctions to the primary market they said Local brokers have requested the head of the syndicate now Fuji Bank Ltd to increase their share to 307 pct but banks oppose any cut in their 74 pct share bankers said wants Japan to agree a timetable for work towards joint rules on capital adequacy for banks along the lines of a January outline agreement between the US and the UK Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said Howard told a Nikkei conference on Tokyo financial markets I want to see an agreement between us on what progress is to be made and the rate at which it will happen Japanese vice-minister of finance for international affairs Toyoo Gyohten told the conference yesterday he was ready to discuss capital adequacy but no negotiations were planned and he could not see how or when agreement would be reached Howard said another issue he would raise during a visit to Japan starting on April 13 was equal access for UK Financial firms to the Japanese market He said 14 London-based financial firms were based in Tokyo nine of them wholly British with licences to deal in securities This compared with 58 wholly-licensed Japanese firms in London I am not a protectionist We welcome all these firms here But I want our firms to be able to compete just as freely in Japan and at the moment they are not allowed to do so he said Airways said

sources said Canada France Italy Sweden the UK US And West Germany are also involved they said Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range a senior central bank official told reporters He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions a dollar fall or a dollar rise Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks he said The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time the senior bank official said but declined to be more specific Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy Asked what factors might destabilize the markets the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan the US Or West Germany or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April That would be little changed from the performance expected this year Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88 but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point he said He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy he added The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy the senior bank official said The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation there could be some problems in the future he said We are sitting on a barrel of powder but fortunately it may still be wet he added Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially he said The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices the bank official said This inflow of funds into the stock exchange occurring also in other countries may continue he said The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year He's a great man the official said adding that more and more people expect his reappointment Turning to exchange rates the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through Even the US Trade position has begun to feel the impact although so far it has not been very strong he said to government plans to impose a five pct sales tax is spreading nationwide ahead of the start of campaigning for local elections next week political analysts said The Asahi Shimbun said 31 of the 47 prefectural assemblies had so far opposed demanded amendments to or expressed wariness about the tax Assemblymen from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have also joined the opposition against the tax in 11 prefectural assemblies the daily reported About 2600 elections will be held on April 12 and 26 for a wide range of local posts including 13 governors The sales tax is one of the main planks of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system A close aide to Nakasone has said the sales tax issue will have a minimal impact on the local elections because centrist parties by and large support LDP candidates in many of the races for governors In the assembly elections even LDP candidates oppose the tax he said On March 8 the LDP lost an Upper House by-election in the conservative stronghold of Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan for the first time in 25 years The opposition socialist winner campaigned on the single issue of the sales tax The surprise LDP defeat in Iwate coupled with Nakasone's sagging popularity has forced the party to compromise with the opposition and agree to postpone public hearings on the fiscal 1987/88 budget to March 19/20 from March 13/14 The opposition parties have been staging recurring parliamentary boycotts to show their disapproval of the sales tax contained in the budget They returned to the Lower House Budget Committee last Friday but walked out again after a few hours demanding detailed data on the tax But parliamentary sources said they are expected to agree in a day or two to dispose of some of 29 bills the LDP will submit The bills include nine which will become extinct on March 31 unless some action is taken the sources said These cover such uncontroversial topics as wages for diplomats and revisions of the law covering court employees Discussion is also expected of a provisional budget to allow the government to continue operating while debate on the main budget continues beyond the April 1 start of fiscal 1987/88 the sources said The provisional budget could cover some 50 days and include authorisation for spending on some public works Otherwise parliament will go into virtual recess until local elections start on April 12 they said Mining Co Ltd> said it will start commercial production of gold copper lead and zinc from its Nurukawa Mine in northern Japan in April A company spokesman said the mine's monthly output is expected to consist of 1300 tonnes of gold ore and 3700 of black ore which consists of copper lead and zinc ores A company survey shows the gold ore contains up to 133 grams of gold per tonne he said Proven gold ore reserves amount to 50000 tonnes while estimated reserves of gold and black ores total one mln tonnes he added extended decline in Japan's overall business performance was likely to bottom out in the current January-March quarter the Finance Ministry said Improved corporate earnings and better prospects for the stability of the yen had made companies more optimistic it said after carrying out a quarterly survey The survey conducted in February was based on questionnaires returned by 8328 large and small firms in all sectors except the finance and insurance industries The survey said overall corporate earnings were expected to turn positive with an estimated 04 pct year on year increase in the second half of fiscal 1986 ending on March 31 after a 54 pct decrease in the first half Corporate earnings will grow further in the first half of fiscal 1987 rising an estimated 107 pct it added Manufacturers' earnings hit hard by the yen's steady rise against the dollar will rise 77 pct in first-half fiscal 1987 after falling 107 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986 it said Overall earnings of non-manufacturing companies will rise 118 pct year on year in the first half of fiscal 1987 after growing 98 pct in the second half of fiscal 1986 the survey said It said this figure was bolstered by profits of firms such as electric power and gas companies which have benefitted from the yen's appreciation should step up the pace of its financial liberalisation if it wants to become a world financial centre equal to New York or London a leading US banker said For Tokyo to become the third link in an international capital markets triangle it will need to create an environment more hospitable to international finance than currently exists Robert Binney senior vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank NA Told a group of Japanese members of parliament and financial leaders Binney said Japan must liberalise its financial markets not just to attract more jobs capital and taxable income but also to recycle effectively its vast trade surpluses to help counter growing protectionism in the United States He called on Japan to remove all controls on deposit interest rates soon and to remove obstacles to the growth of its offshore market He also said it should fully deregulate its short-term money markets develop comprehensive futures markets further open the Tokyo Stock Exchange to foreign membership and remove fixed rate brokerage commissions Binney also urged Japan to abolish Article 25 of its Securities and Exchange Law which like the US Glass Steagall Act separates commercial from investment banking At the same meeting Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp president Eugene Atkinson urged Japan to fully de-regulate short-term interest rates introduce commercial paper and open long-term government bond markets to an auction system He said Japan should allow securities firms to participate in foreign exchange business and develop over-the-counter stock options and futures Short-selling of Japanese government cash bonds was a vital hedging mechanism he added The group of some 60 Japanese legislators and financial leaders which Atkinson and Binney addressed was recently formed to study ways in which Japan should promote liberalisation of its financial markets We should not leave such matters solely to government bureaucrats Masao Hori Chairman of the lower house finance committee told the group Corp <NESIT> may take legal action to halt introduction of <Seiko Epson Corp>'s NEC-compatible personal computer series which NEC alleges infringes copyrights for NEC's 9801 V computer series an NEC official said We may have no choice but to take legal action the NEC official said A Seiko Epson official said the company's PC 286 series the first NEC-compatible personal computer does not infringe on NEC copyrights He said the company intends to go ahead with plans to market the computers from late April A Seiko Epson official said of the new machine It's compatible with NEC's machine so it appears similar But our intention was to develop an original machine Industry analysts said NEC controls about 70 pct of the domestic personal computer market They said introduction of NEC-compatible machines could start a price war and cut NEC's profits as happened to IBM following the introduction of IBM-compatible machines Motor Corp <TOYOT> is likely to name more American companies as suppliers of car parts for its wholly-owned US Subsidiary Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA Inc (TMM) a Toyota official told Toyota is studying the use of General Motors Corp's <GMN> GM Delco Products as a supplier of motors for windshield wipers and Illinois Tool Works Inc for window handles he said Another US Firm may be used to supply radiator tanks Toyota had originally planned to use two Japanese companies to supply the parts Nippondenso Co Ltd <DNOTT> and Aisin Seiki Co Ltd Toyota is also considering some other US Firms as suppliers but the spokesman declined to name them Cars produced at Toyota's Kentucky plant will consist of 60 pct local content instead of an earlier planned 50 pct he said The plant is scheduled to start production in mid-1988 and have an annual capacity of 200000 cars Industry sources said the Toyota move was designed to head off criticism that it was not using enough US Company-made parts at its Kentucky plant Corp <BRITT> said it and <Clevite Industries Inc> of the United States will launch a joint venture in the US To produce parts for car engines The joint firm is to have a capital of 40 mln dlrs and will produce rubber for cushioning car engines from vibration Launch date for the company be owned 51 pct by Clevite and 49 pct by Bridgestone is to be in June banks may have to realize significant losses on their seven billion dlrs in perpetual floating rate notes after the recent collapse of the market bankers said How much of a loss is realized in the current fiscal year ending March 31 depends on the accounting treatment recommended by the Finance Ministry Ministry sources said the Ministry has yet to decide what guidance to give Japanese banks in valuing the perpetual floating rate notes they hold The notes are held by Japanese city trust long-term and regional banks including their overseas branches Roughly half of the Japanese banks assess foreign asset portfolios on the basis of current market prices while the others assess them at either the acquisition cost or the current market price whichever is lower bankers said With the market for such perpetuals non-existent Finance Ministry officials questioned the propriety of using nominal quotations supplied by the notes' lead managers to determine bank book losses The Ministry is currently awaiting a legal judgement by the National Tax Administration Agency on the propriety of using such quotations one official said Banks using current market prices alone to value their holdings can avoid realizing losses now because they can argue that the market is non-existent and hope for a recovery next year bankers said But those banks who use acquisition cost to value foreign portfolios cannot look to the market bankers said The acquisition cost is obviously higher than the market price whatever it may be these banks must realize losses in the current fiscal year Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range a senior central bank official told reporters He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions a dollar fall or a dollar rise Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency

of stock exchange prices the bank official said This inflow of funds into the stock exchange occurring also in other countries may continue he said European Community (EC) delivered warnings to both Japan and the United States over trade frictions which have hit relations between the Community and its main trading partners EC foreign ministers meeting here issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for greater effort by the country to open its markets Ministers also issued a statement saying they were disturbed by moves in the US to limit imports of textiles and warned that the Community would react to any such moves EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has already written to his US counterpart special US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter outlining the EC's concerns The ministers' said they were very disturbed by the US moves adding the adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations Any unilateral US moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the world trade body the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) they said In a separate statement on Japan the EC ministers said they deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade  (and) expect Japan to open up its market more The statement added that the EC continued to insist that the Japanese government must boost imports and stimulate demand Ministers also called on the European Commission to prepare a report on US-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take action where necessary One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop It wil be back on the table again and again the diplomat said De Clercq told journalists There is a certain nervousness a growing impatience within the Community on trade relations with Japan But diplomats said the Community is keen to continue talking with Tokyo to try and solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he had no intention of modifying at the moment a proposed bill introducing a sales tax Parliamentary deliberation must be conducted fully before we see whether to revise it or not Miyazawa told reporters He also said he had not heard anything about Deputy Premier Shin Kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as he saw growing public opposition Debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic opposition boycott over their objections to the tax Miyazawa said he did not expect the bill to be altered even after Parliament completes its deliberations He also said the Government is undecided on the scale of a proposed provisional budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on April 1 The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than 1000 billion yen The Government is working on a provisional budget as the chances of passing a full one by April 1 are virtually nil as a result of the halt in parliamentary business officials said The Government wants to include as many economic stimuli as possible in the provisional budget to boost domestic demand increase imports and reduce its trade surplus they said overall wholesale price index (base 1980) fell 01 pct in February from a month earlier to 864 for the second consecutive month-on-month fall the Bank of Japan said Wholesale prices fell 06 pct in January from December The index fell 91 pct from a year earlier for the 21st straight year-on-year drop the central bank said The reduced month-on-month drop mainly stemmed from the recovery in world crude oil prices it said On a customs-cleared basis crude oil prices rose to around 17 dlrs a barrel in February from about 15 dlrs in January The average value of the yen against the dollar rose 08 pct to 15350 in February from 15467 in January and was up 168 pct from 18455 a year earlier the bank said The export price index in February fell 07 pct from a month earlier reflecting price cuts in export products like cars and precision instruments due to severe foreign competition The index was down 71 pct from a year earlier The import price index rose 11 pct from a month earlier to 574 for the sixth successive month-on-month gain mainly due to the continued strength of world crude oil prices But the index was down 29 pct from a year earlier The domestic price index fell 01 pct to 919 in February its 24th straight monthly drop mainly reflecting falls in prices of home appliances such as colour televisions due to severe sales competition at home Lower edible oil prices added to the decline The index was down 67 pct from a year earlier The domestic index marked its largest year-on-year drop of 71 pct in January since the central bank started compiling such statistics in 1960 under its current system Wholesale prices are likely to turn upward in March as higher world crude oil and raw material prices are expected the bank said Bank Ltd's Hong Kong branch is planning a 40 mln New Zealand dlr certificate of deposit CD issue banking sources said The three-year CDs are denominated in 100000 dlr units and will carry interest at 375 basis points below the three-month New Zealand bank bill rate Payment date is expected to be around April 1 ANZ Securities Asia Ltd is lead manager for the issue Motor Corp <TOYOT> of Japan is expected to get approval from a Philippine government agency to produce cars and other items here government sources said This follows the company's proposal to invest about 400 mln pesos and generate about 100 mln dlrs in export earnings over five years The sources said Toyota is likely to be brought into the government-backed Progressive Car Manufacturing Program (PCMP) which since the 1970s has controlled the number of car makers The PCMP is administered by the Board of Investments (BOI) which screens investments by foreigners and locals The sources said Toyota had also applied to produce wiring harness hardboard and ferro-silicone for local and export markets It has not yet said what kind of cars it will make The sources did not say when BOI would announce its decision on the Toyota application In 1984 Toyota severed its ties with <Delta Motor Corp> its local partner for more than 20 years because the latter was suffering financial difficulties The state-owned Philippine National Bank later foreclosed on Delta's assets and the sources said Toyota is now negotiating to buy these The government sources also said Toyota was in the final stages of negotiations with a new local partner Toyota would be the third participant in the PCMP joining <Pilipinas Nissan Inc> and <Philippine Automotive Manufacturing Corp> formerly Canlubang Automotive Resources Corp Two US Car firms General Motors Corp <GMN> and Ford Motor Co <FN> withdrew from the local car market shortly after the country was hit by a financial crisis in 1983 dollar sentiment is bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by said here The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 15000 yen and to fall even below that level a senior dealer at one leading bank said The dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 15150 yen Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of US Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of US Treasury securities needed to finance the US Deficit Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further US Steps to weaken the dollar Under the Paris accord Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said If no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the US Congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said The factors affecting the US Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord they added Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish US Economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 14000 yen by the end of this year said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the US Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 187 marks The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 160 dlrs on Wednesday they said But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars However First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March Other dealers said the US Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of US Treasury securities US Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said Economic Planning Agency will announce gross national product (GNP) figures for the October/December quarter today at 1700 hrs local time (0800 gmt) Agency officials told In the July/September quarter GNP rose 06 pct from the previous three months European Community (EC) yesterday warned Japan and the United States its main trading partners that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations with both countries EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the US Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react The US Administration has already distanced itself from the bill EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his US Counterpart Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter outlining the EC's concerns The statement said ministers were very disturbed by US Moves towards protectionism The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations it said Any unilateral US Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it said In a separate statement on Japan the EC ministers said they deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on US-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop It will be back on the table again and again the diplomat said De Clercq talking to journalists during the meeting said There is a certain nervousness a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its trade surplus and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers where it has imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research Kobe Rubber Exchange said it will extend its trading hours from May 1 to enable more operators to use the exchange Subject to Ministry of International Trade and Industry approval the Exchange will add a sixth session starting at 1700 local time and will close the account for trading at the new session the following day before the opening call starts at 0930 local time an Exchange official said Trading on the Singapore rubber market a major producer price indicator for Japanese end-users is usually active after the end of the current final session here The introduction of the new session will enable participants to trade overnight after taking account of Singapore rubber prices because brokers and members who are designated by the Kobe Exchange are allowed to add the volume traded overnight to the new final session before the opening session starts next day the official said But because the Kobe Exchange uses the auction system which sets a fixed price at each session the price of contracts traded overnight should be a fixed price settled at the sixth session he added Industry sources said they expected the Ministry to approve the plan because it has encouraged the Japanese futures industry to expand and internationalise The Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry TOCOM which also trades rubber futures in Japan said it has no plans to introduce an extra session TOCOM also has five rubber trading sessions a day Four sessions start 15 minutes later than Kobe Exchange sessions but both Exchanges' final sessions start at the same time broadly defined money supply average of M-2 plus certificate of deposits (CDs) rose a preliminary 88 pct in February from a year earlier compared with an 86 pct rise in January the Bank of Japan said The seasonally adjusted February average of M-2 plus CDs supply rose 08 pct from January it said Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs stood at an average 336000 billion yen in February compared with 337100 billion yen in January gross national product (GNP) rose a real 08 pct in the October/December quarter after an upwardly revised 07 pct increase the previous three months the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said The rise in the July/September quarter had originally been put at 06 pct The annualized growth rate accelerated to 32 pct in October/December from 30 pct in July/September In the 1986 calendar year GNP rose 25 pct after a 47 pct increase in 1985 Last year's performance was the worst since 1974 when GNP fell 14 pct Agency officials blamed the strong yen for depressing exports and manufacturing industry In nominal terms GNP rose 05 pct in the October/December quarter reflecting stable prices after a one pct increase in the previous three months the Agency said Domestic real demand increased 06 pct in October/December after a one pct rise the previous quarter Domestic demand contributed 05 percentage point to real GNP growth in October/December while foreign trade added 02 The figures do not tally exactly due to rounding In July/September domestic demand contributed one percentage point to GNP growth while foreign trade knocked off 03 point Of the 02 point contribution of foreign trade to GNP last quarter falling exports knocked off 02 while falling imports contributed 04 point Total export volume fell 12 pct quarter on quarter in October/December Imports also fell by 29 pct Of the 05 point contribution of domestic demand to October/December GNP growth the private sector accounted for 04 point and the public sector 02 The private sector contribution included 03 point for housebuilding 04 for corporate capital outlays and 01 for stockbuilding Consumer spending had a 04 negative impact government will find it very difficult to achieve its new gross national product (GNP) forecast of three pct growth in the fiscal year ending March 31 Economic Planning Agency officials said They made the comment to reporters after news that GNP rose 08 pct in the October/December quarter after a 07 pct increase the previous three months For Japan to achieve three pct growth in 1986/87 GNP in the January/March period would have to grow 26 pct from October/December the officials said The government lowered its GNP forecast for 1986/87 from four pct last December Ltd's <SLBN> decision to end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> to buy 80 pct of its <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> and the political furore that surrounded the proposed sale will make Japanese companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire US High technology firms but will not halt such attempts industry analysts said The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future US Expansion by the Japanese firm said analysts polled by The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's North American operations but it would have been a great boost James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending the agreement because mounting political controversy in the US Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake could be completed in a reasonable time The sale was opposed by the US Commerce Department and Defence Department partly on national security grounds Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North American sales and distribution system and access to microprocessor technology an area where Fujitsu is weak analysts said The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional microchip production facilities worldwide eight of them in the US A report by the Capel firm said It was an entry point a port for semiconductors and a marketing channel for other things said Barclays de Zoete Wedd analyst Rick May Several analysts said the purchase would not have given Fujitsu access to critical defence technology (Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a thing of the past May said The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to modernise Fairchild's production lines Capel's Murtha said The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire US High tech firms but they are unlikely to stop analysts said Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly route of expanding its own production and distribution facilities in the US Although some said it could use the estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to acquire some less politically symbolic firm It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions but the necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in America remains said Capel's Murtha The Japanese will continue to shop for bargains but it will be harder to find ones that are politically acceptable Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash that blocked the Fairchild sale analysts said They're not going to slow up they're just going to buy smaller pieces  Because of the political risk said Barclays de Zoete's May Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct shares in smaller US High technology firms such as super minicomputer makers he said Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up harming US Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational tie-ups some analysts said This is not really of benefit to US Firms either said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards The pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move -- why should the government step in to prevent it? Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura told a press conference that interference by US Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter for governments' comment Tamura said I think it was improper for US Government officials to intervene to the extent they did he said A spokesman told the ministry's view is that international investment flows ought to be free and that such flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing closeness of US-Japanese economic ties Bank of Japan will sell 300 billion yen of financing bills tomorrow under a 55-day repurchase accord maturing on May 12 money traders said The bills are meant to soak up a projected money market surplus due largely to coupon and principle payments of a previously issued Japanese National Railways bond The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39497 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate for two-month commercial bills and the 443/32 pct yield on two-month certificates of deposit today The sale will raise the bill supply to 1500 billion yen has complained to the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan breaks GATT rules Trade Ministry officials here said They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more from the US And elsewhere was tantamount to creating non-tariff trade barriers South Korea unveiled the plan in November It said it hoped to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by 1991 South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 545 billion dlrs in 1986 and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to import Japanese goods and to exporters to sell more to Japan The officials said they believed the Japanese action one step short of filing a suit was designed to bring South Korea to the negotiating table and stop the plan The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean goods to help reduce the trade deficit Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April but the cutback ratio has not been set yet industry sources said Production prices the basis for setting intervention prices have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices they said Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values the sources added In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25 ministry officials said At present the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef known as marbled beef is 1400 yen per kilo while its ceiling is 1820 they said The standard price of other beef mainly produced from dairy steers is now 1090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1420 the officials said The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760 They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market Japan sets an annual beef import quota A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices they said ended January 31 Parent shr 573 yen vs 580 Div five yen vs same Net 701 billion vs 677 billion Current 2406 billion vs 2376 billion Operating 3762

help reduce debt and restore profitability within two years Half of the sum raised will be returned to creditor banks which in December were asked to temporarily waive part of their loan repayments it said The other half will be used to bolster operations hit by the yen's steep appreciation and the global shipping slump the company added MORE Motor Co Ltd <HMCT> said it shifted production of motorcycles with engine capacity of 700 cc and bigger for sale in the US To its wholly owned subsidiary <Honda Motor of America Inc> in Ohio partly due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar A parent company spokesman said the Ohio plant which makes 360000 cars a year is now also producing 1100 cc and 1200 cc motorcycles partly for export Motorcycle output in Ohio totalled 28000 in 1986 down 33 pct from a year earlier but the shift in production will raise production to 44000 in 1987 the spokesman said The move to the US Of large motorcycle manufacturing was also due partly to higher US Tariffs for imported motorcyles bigger than 700 cc industry sources said The US Imposed tariffs on imports of large motorcycles from April 1983 starting at 499 pct and gradually falling to help the US Motorcycle manufacturing industry to reconstruct the sources said The tariff for US Fiscal year 1987/88 is set at 145 pct They said the US Planned to cut the tariff to 44 pct for fiscal 1988/89 but that the higher level is likely to be kept for a few years due to the slow pace of reconstruction Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> and Mitsui and Co Ltd <MITST> are likely to win an order for oil-related equipment worth about 600 mln yen this week from a Hungarian company trading in equipment for the chemical industry sources in the industry said The equipment developed by Royal Dutch/Shell Group

transport people between terminals He would not confirm a local report which said the system would cost about 30 mln dlrs The proposal is one of several being considered The US Europe and South Korea are pushing hard for greater foreign participation officials sought to convince the US That a US-Japan pact on microchip trade is working ahead of an April 1 deadline set by the US For them to prove their case We are implementing the agreement in good faith and the situation does not run counter to the pact Osamu Watanabe Director of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's (MITI) Americas and Oceanic Division told foreign reporters The effects of the measures we have taken and are taking are emerging in the market place he said US Trade officials have repeatedly accused Japanese microchip makers of violating the pact by continuing to sell at below cost in markets outside Japan and the United States The agreement signed last September aimed at halting predatory Japanese pricing policies and increasing US Semiconductor firms' access to the Japanese market The comments by MITI officials followed a call by Prime Minsiter Yasuhiro Nakasone to clear up any misunderstandings on the US Side about the pact Watanabe said Yukio Honda director of MITI's Industrial Electronics Division denied that Japanese chipmakers were selling at below cost in third countries MITI's call to Japanese chip makers last month to cut production of key memory chips in the first quarter of this year has begun to dry up the source of cheap chips for sale in the non-regulated grey market Honda said The grey market exports from Japan are shrinking now but in contrast US And South Korean companies are expanding market share because of their cheaper prices Honda said MITI plans to take further steps to reduce the excess supply of inexpensive chips which developed in Japan after the pact was formed because of a slump in Japanese semiconductor exports to the United States he added The ministry will soon release its supply-demand guidelines for the second quarter and suggested production volumes are likely to be lower than that for the first quarter he said Despite businessmen's ingenuity in finding ways around any artificial controls regulation of supply and demand should bring positive results Watanabe said I am optimistic he added Bank of Japan

bearish and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord foreign exchange analysts polled by said here The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 15000 yen and to fall even below that level a senior dealer at one leading bank said The dollar has eased this week but remains stable at around 15150 yen Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term but a drastic fall is unlikely because of US Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of US Treasury securities needed to finance the US Deficit Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly and said such measures would probably invite further US Steps to weaken the dollar Under the Paris accord Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and cut its trade surplus But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future the dealers said If no such steps are taken protectionist sentiment in the US Congress will grow putting greater downward pressure on the dollar they said The factors affecting the US Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord they added Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish US Economic outlook the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 14000 yen by the end of this year said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the US Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 187 marks The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 160 dlrs on Wednesday they said But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars However First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March Other dealers said the US Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31 because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings which could make them lose interest in purchases of US Treasury securities US Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates they said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he had no intention of modifying at the moment a proposed bill introducing a sales tax Parliamentary deliberation must be conducted fully before we see whether to revise it or not Miyazawa told reporters He also said he had not heard anything about Deputy Premier Shin Kanemaru suggesting modification of the tax The Japanese press has reported that Kanemaru proposed yesterday a freeze or a modification of the value-added tax as he saw growing public opposition Debate on the sales tax has been stalled by a sporadic opposition boycott over their objections to the tax Miyazawa said he did not expect the bill to be altered even after Parliament completes its deliberations He also said the Government is undecided on the scale of a proposed provisional budget for fiscal 1987 beginning on April 1 The minister declined to comment on wide-spread press speculation that the stop-gap budget would total more than 1000 billion yen Cypriot tanker was set ablaze in the Persian Gulf yesterday after an Iranian gunboat fired missiles at it shipping sources quoting reports from Japanese tankers said today No casualties were seen and the tanker Pivot laden with crude oil was towed towards Dubai by tugs after they put out the fire the sources said Iranian gunboats usually check a ship's nationality and cargo before attacking but the Pivot was hit near Bu Musa island without warning they added Japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986 private economists said Consumer spending a main driving force of domestic demand was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year the economists said They said they were shocked by an Economic Planning Agency report today that private spending fell 07 pct in the Oct/Dec quarter for the first time in 12 years The report said Japan's gross national product rose a real 08 pct in Oct/Dec after a revised 07 pct increase in the previous quarter It said GNP growth for 1986 was a real 25 pct down from 47 pct in 1985 Agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when GNP contracted 14 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis They expressed concern about the 07 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales But most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off Sure consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises said Shoji Saito general manager of Mitsui Bank's economic research division He said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise Masao Suzaki senior economist at the Bank of Tokyo said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor Without brisk consumer spending Japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures he said Other economists said the 08 pct growth registered in Oct/Dec may have been inflated by special factors including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector Johsen Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute said the 144 pct increase in public sector spending in Oct/Dec resulted from an issue of gold coins This is just a one-shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public-sector consumption in the following quarter Takahashi said Agency officials said public spending would have risen 11 pct in Oct/Dec without the issue which marked 60 years of Emperor Hirohito's reign Takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending Saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next January of a proposed controversial sales tax of fish meal by the three South American producers -- Chile Peru and Equador -- last year reached 25 mln tonnes equalling the record output of 1970 the International Association of Fish Meal Manufacturers (IAFMM) said However IAFMM said in a statement that it expected Chilean and Peruvian fish meal production in the first quarter of 1987 to be much lower than the 651000 tonnes produced in the last quarter of 1986 due to a ban on sardine fishing in Chile for the month of February and to adverse fishing conditions in Peru in the same month The statement added that due to technical market promotion and energetic sales by Chile and Peru the stock position at the end of the year remained reasonable Fish meal production outside South America decreased slightly falling from 114400 to 111100 tonnes The IAFMM said fish meal consumption in 1986 rose in West Germany Scandinavian countries Eastern Europe and the Far East but fell in the US And remained static in the UK It added that fish meal consumption had suffered from competition with feed grade tallow in the US And with skimmed milk powder in the UK

affecting the EC's relations with both countries EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the US Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react The US Administration has already distanced itself from the bill EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his US Counterpart Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter outlining the EC's concerns The statement said ministers were very disturbed by US Moves towards protectionism The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started as well as on bilateral relations it said Any unilateral US Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it said In a separate statement on Japan the EC ministers said they deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on US-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop It will be back on the table again and again the diplomat said De Clercq talking to journalists during the meeting said There is a certain nervousness a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research told the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that South Korea's five-year import diversification plan violated the spirit of the world trade governing body a Foreign Ministry spokesman said The notification came in Japan's answer to a recent GATT questionnaire on unfair trade practices the spokesman said In the five-year plan which starts this year South Korea aims to reduce its dependency on Japan as a source of imported goods and to increase imports from the US And Europe Japan's move came after several unsuccessful bilateral negotiations on the plan the spokesman said The notification does not represent anything resembling a formal complaint nor is it intended to pressure South Korea It is a routine procedure followed by all other GATT member states Holdings Plc <GLXOL> said it has filed an application to obtain a listing of its ordinary shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange It said in a statement it expects to obtain the listing by by the end of the company's financial year on June 30 No new shares will be issued in connection with the listing on the Tokyo exchange Glaxo said On February 18 Glaxo said it was seeking to list its American Depositary receipts now traded on the NASDAQ system on the New York Stock Exchange It also expected this listing to be in place by June 30 Treasury Secretary James Baker said an agreement has been reached by members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to control the unfair trade practice of using tied aid to promote trade He said in a statement the agreement culminates the Reagan administration's effot to negotiate a virtual end to export credit subsidies The practice of other governments using tied aid or mixed credits to promote exports has cost the United States lost jobs and lost exports the Treasury said The agreement to be implemented in two stages by July 1988 would ban tied aid credit among industrialized countries and place limits on permitted aid by developing countries It would also reduce export credits that do not involve aid and reduce credit subsidies permitted for relatively poor countries the Treasury said Baker said the agreement imposes particular sacrifices on Japan and praised Japan's willingness to accept the pact as a demonstration of the Japanese government's willingness to take concrete steps to resolve important trade issues dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth a top Bundesbank official said Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability The Paris agreement was not however an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates Gleske stressed adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen Gleske said He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong and further falls there may still be necessary But a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position as measured by its weighted external value he said In fact a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers Gleske said First in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses Second in the United States it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits Gleske said Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies fluctuating in narrow bands against each other can be established Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts both within countries and between them For instance the US Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels but domestic considerations call for low ones If target zones were established this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities he said Gleske added targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities Commenting on the Paris currency accord Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained These chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates and the monetary policies behind them will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot He said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible Monetary policies can help achieve this but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments he said Inc said it is petitioning the International Trade Commission to lift import taxes on Japanese motorcycle manufacturers Harley-Davidson said it no longer needed tariff relief to compete with the Japanese It said President Reagan imposed the tariff in April 1983 after Harley-Davidson convinced the administration the Japanese were eroding the US motorcycle industry by flooding the market with its own models Harley-Davidson said it has increased its market share of the heavyweight motorcycle to 194 pct in 1986 from a record low 125 pct in 1983 Reagan administration will consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive industries such as semiconductors and computers the New York Times said quoting an unnamed senior administration official I think there's a strong sentiment here that some industries are not totally up for grabs the paper quoted the official as saying Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and computer companies said the official who the newspaper said was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> takeover bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday and industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition in the important computer chip manufacturing industry Officials told last week that Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger Ltd <SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could have left the US Military dependent on foreign sources for vital technology The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas Everybody wants an open investment policy but there have to be some exceptions for the national interest Baldrige was quoted as saying The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency policymaking group such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security Council the strong yen has usurped Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster as Japan's favourite horror story The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15000 dlrs a month But endaka like many Japanese products is for foreign consumption locals and long-time foreign residents said It's not really that expensive I don't pay attention to the cost of living said Cheryl Richmond a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo Richmond said she earns 1635 dlrs a month by chatting 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku one of Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month She spends less than 650 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet pickles miso soup rice and tea although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner No one argues that Tokyo is cheap but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2000 to 15000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes The companies feel otherwise They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down It's not reasonable said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM) which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business travellers a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day While the businessmen have little choice but to come here many tourists especially those from Europe are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates endaka caused an 115 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year Those who came tried to cut back on expenses chiefly by curtailing shopping it said To help combat endaka and the slump in tourism the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet Economical Travel in Japan It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced business hotels and Japanese-style inns cheap sushi and public baths while getting a revealing glimpse of

Banks steel and other businesses In the latest attempt Fujitsu Ltd <ITSUT> -- Japan's biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for <Fairchild Semiconductor Corp> a US Microchip maker which supplies components for supercomputers Nomura Securities Co Ltd <NMSCT> and Daiwa Securities Co Ltd <DSECT> Japan's two largest brokerage firms are seeking a niche in the US And European securities markets while the country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas banking the takeover specialists said Major trading houses which see their profits evaporating in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade all have foreign businesses on their shopping lists Among manufacturers car parts makers are under the most pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto makers they subcontract for as these move offshore The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up potential overseas businesses especially in the US -- Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal a takeover specialist at one trading company said Japanese companies have become among the world's richest after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months But the yen's strength which has also raised the costs of Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into its traditional markets has frozen Japanese corporate growth the specialists said Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more barriers against Japanese exports Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work Domestic interest rates now at record lows offer little investment opportunity Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous but the recent economic factors have become a driving force said a banking industry source So far though the Japanese are being cautious While mergers and acquisitions among US Firms number in the thousands Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have totalled just a few dozen one merchant banker said Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese acquisition activity was originally expected five years from now but that time span appeared now to be too long Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now he said A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals Inc's <DIACT> takeover bid for <Sun Chemical Corp> of the US Last year which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile he added Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for 550 mln dlrs late last year after an earlier unsolicited bid for the whole company Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all but its graphic arts-related businesses Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon by the Japanese the trading company official says Japanese people don't like fighting They prefer peaceful amicable deals But now after some experience overseas Japanese companies are acquainted with local practice he adds This is a healthy progression However the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the board meetings of any giant US Or European concerns Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a large US Or European corporation one banker said They will expand their operations only gradually a typical way for Japanese business A foreign merchant banker also noted There are not many mega-deals left to do in the United States A lot of the big deals there have already been done But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of Japanese companies the specialists said Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in high-technology areas Japanese companies had used technology and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate from that trend one takeover specialist said Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions If these succeed activity could build the specialists said But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait until the action begins Already they said Japanese trading houses long-term credit and commercial banks brokerages and foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) bond managers said Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures said Katsuyuki Okayasu general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market said Tetsuya Dezuka deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd one of the most active yen bond brokers in London Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there dealers said Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140000 billion yen with most held in Japan they said An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link US Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago enabling a continuous 12-hour session bond managers here said adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last December But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets dealers said Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen but the extent of investor- linked transactions is unknown securities bond managers said Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London suggesting they increasingly are engaging in not only fund raising but management there Dezuka said The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of US And UK Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's growth dealers said Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year securities managers said The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the US Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract they said The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country Fundamental Brokers Inc a major US Brokers' broker has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April CBOT's start of an evening session planned for the end of April will also multiply yen bond futures trading a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE said Koki Chiyojima deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's bond administration division Nikko Securities Co Ltd one of the big four Japanese securities houses is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September or June and December from April 1 matching futures delivery months The ministry now pays coupons in January June July and December When delivery months and coupon payments do not match a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-resident bond holders a deterrent to LIFFE securities managers said LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen bond managers said These bonds will be used for deliveries as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates they said Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987 Corp <SNET> group net income is expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31 from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen if the yendollar rate remains at the present level managing director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending March 31 as its financial year will be changed to run from April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550 billion yen down five pct from a year earlier he said The company earlier reported net income of 765 billion yen in the three month period ended January 31 down 592 pct from a year earlier on sales of 34306 billion down 63 pct The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by 40 billion yen Hashimoto said Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300000 units in the three months unchanged from a year earlier while Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300000 from 350000 Sales of compact disc players rose to 450000 from 300000 and those of the Walkman rose to 225 mln from 130 mln but colour television sales fell to 950000 from one mln due to lower exports to China Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986 Hashimoto said Overseas sales accounted for 682 pct of the total in the three months compared with 713 pct a year earlier Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total production in 1990 from the present 20 pct Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month period is estimated at around 17 billion yen down 33 pct from a year earlier on sales of 400 billion down 12 pct Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April 1 1987 he added The company made 419 billion yen group net profit in the year ended November 31 1986 down 426 pct from a year earlier on sales of 1325 billion down 67 pct parliamentary boycott by opposition members has forced the government to compile its largest-ever provisional budget finance ministry officials said The 7900 billion yen budget for the first 50 days of fiscal 1988 starting April exceeds the previous record of 3040 billion yen for an 11-day budget in fiscal 1984 An on-again off-again parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over a proposed five pct sales tax has prevented passage of the full 1987/88 budget within the current year ending March 31 The stop-gap budget which is expected to pass parliament on March 31 is designed to respond to mounting calls for economic stimulus from domestic industries hard hit by the yen's sharp rise officials said It will include as much as 1800 billion yen for public works about 30 pct of the 6000 billion yen earmarked for such works in the full budget Traditionally a provisional budget covers only day-to-day mandatory expenses The government also expects the budget to meet pressure from trading partners for an expansion of Japanese domestic demand they said The budget includes expenditures for a program to create 300000 jobs and other reflationary measures the officials said They quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) secretary general Noboru Takeshita as telling opposition party officials yesterday that the budget should include as much pump-priming as possible Economists said confidence of opposition members in their campaign to scrap the sales tax has been heightened by their success in forcing the adoption of a stop-gap budget and could lead to even further delays in passing the full budget The result may be that the government will have to delay its planned announcement of a set of pump-priming measures in April economists said That package is expected to include a plan to carry out more than 80 pct of total 1987/88 public works in the first half of the fiscal year a government official said Japanese press reports said some LDP executives suggested Nakasone may have to give up plans to visit Washington in April because of the sales tax confrontation Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan to prepare for the economic summit of seven major industrial democracies in June they added very strong earthquake that struck southwest Japan killed one person and injured at least three cracked walls and cut telephone lines authorities said The quake at 0336 GMT registered 69 on the Richter scale and officials issued warnings of tidal waves of up to two metres high they said A man died in Miyazaki prefecture when his truck overturned and another was seriously hurt when his roof caved in police said Two primary school children were hurt by flying shards of glass as they sat in their classroom The extent of their injuries was not immediately known A police spokesman in the western Kyushu city of Miyazaki one of the worst hit areas said walls cracked all over town Weather officials told the quake's epicentre was 50 km underground and 40 km offshore east of the city of Hyuga on Kyushu's eastern coast Maritime Safety Agency authorities ordered fishermen along the Kyushu coast to return to port and dispatched a fleet of six search boats to see them safely back Telephone links with the island were badly disrupted and all trains in the area were been stopped as a precaution police said Finance Ministry said it will allow more foreign brokers to participate in government note auctions from April by abolishing a requirement that participants have current accounts with the Bank of Japan This will allow 18 more Japanese branches of foreign-owned brokerages to bid it said Currently 22 foreign brokers are allowed to bid Bidders for two three and four-year notes must be members of the underwriting syndicate for five-year discount notes and 10 and 20-year government bonds New tender participants are: Vickers da Costa Ltd; Bache Securities Ltd; Smith Barney Harris Upham International Inc; Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd; Kidder Peabody and Co Ltd; Goldman Sachs International Corp; Morgan Stanley Co Ltd; SG Warburg and Co Ltd; First Boston Co Ltd; Kleinwort Benson International Inc; Schroder Securities Ltd; Deutsche Bank AG; EF Hutton Ltd; Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc; Dresdner Bank AG; Swiss Union Philips and Drew Ltd; Sogen Security Corp and Swiss Bank Corp International Asia Inc Only these 18 Japanese branches of foreign-owned brokers would meet other existing requirements to participate on-off parliamentary boycott has forced Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to adopt a provisional budget government officials said Economic analysts saw this as another setback in Nakasone's plans to overhaul the Japanese tax system The parliamentary boycott by opposition parties over Nakasone's plans for a five per cent sales tax has made it impossible for the full 1987-88 budget to be passed by the start of the fiscal year on April 1 government officials said and Wireless PLC <CAWLL> and the Pacific Telesis group <PACN> may take part in a proposed merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's international telecommunications market a senior industry official said Fumio Watanabe head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) told a news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums agreed that the US And British companies will be invited to participate in the new merged firm The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only one private company should enter the market The two consortiums <International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC) and <International Telecom Japan> (ITJ) were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985 Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged consortium at less than three pct and added that even the largest shareholders could own only some five pct  Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house <C Itoh and Co> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MERN> jointly hold 13 pct  ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses Several firms including Toyota Motor Corp <TOYOT> belong to both Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the government on having only one private consortium as two companies might invest excessive amounts He said talks with Cable & Wireless will continue this week city of Rotterdam today signed an agreement in principle to cooperate with the AOMI Cargo Distribution Centre in Tokyo Acting Mayor Roel den Dunnen said that cooperation between private and public entities in the Tokyo and Rotterdam area and a fruitful exchange of information have a favourable influence on the flow of goods and services between the two countries The AOMI Cargo Distribution Center which will start operating in October this year signed a similar agreement with Rotterdam's twinned-port of Seattle last September Inc said it signed the previously announced agreements with Sumitomo Bakelite Co Ltd Tokyo Japan providing for a joint participation program for manufacturing flexible circuits and circuitry components Under terms of the agreement each company granted the other a license to use flexible circuit and related technology As part of the transaction Sumitomo Bakelite has purchased 10 pct or 325000 shares of Sheldahl common stock In addition Sheldahl will be a minority holder in Sumitomo's next flexible circuit manufacturing operation in Japan ailing shipbuilding industry plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts and greater use of computers industry sources told The salvage measures which include a government-sponsored rationalisation program are aimed at clawing back some of the market which Japan the world leader has lost to South Korea through currency and labour cost disadvantages they said The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct more competitive than Japan's due to such factors The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of current capacity within two years through mergers and regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month and likely to be approved by May or June the sources said They said from September a semi-government body will assure repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity and another 30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment Last Friday the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1 The commission has held several hearings with the industry and approval should be given this month the sources said A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support should help Japanese yards recover their international competitiveness they said Under the cartel proposals 33 yards each capable of building ships of more than 10000 gross tonnes would build a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT) in 1987/88 This is about half of total capacity This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most yards to sign orders below cost the sources said The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for 1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to 31 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 33 mln in 1987/88 they said The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20000 to 30000 of the estimated 100000 workers in the industry between 1986 and 1989 Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December followed by South Korea and Taiwan according to Lloyd's Register of Shipping However falling orders and declining international competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in the industry the sources said Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding companies reported current deficits in the first half of the year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report current deficits for the whole of 1986/7 they said The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt years the sources said In Japan no single yard leads the industry resulting in fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity The two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd <JIMAT> -- account for only 30 pct of ships built the sources said World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out the recession as their technology is the best in the world said an official at a major Japanese shipping company The Japanese merchant fleet the largest after Liberia's has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships and this will encourage Japanese yards the sources said Express Co climbed 2-1/2 to 80-1/8 on rumors the company was about to announce an agreement to sell 10 pct of its Shearson Lehman Brothers unit to Nippon bLife Insurance of Japan traders said Speculation about an impending deal rumored to be worth 600 mln dlrs also sent shares of other US brokerages up sharply PaineWebber Group Inc <PWJ> gained 1-5/8 to 37-1/8 and Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> rose 1-3/8 to 42-7/8 American Express officials declined comment but cited a statement it released more than two weeks ago in which it said it was studying matters of strategic importance American Express officials also pointed out the earlier statement issued March one said it is company policy not to comment on rumors or speculation The earlier announcement also said American Express and Shearson were studying options including expansion of capacity to meet international competition and broadening access to capital The latest rumors originated in Tokyo traders said If the rumors are true it gives them a nice infusion of capital for an attractive price said Lawrence Eckenfelder analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Lehman Brothers Inc said it has sold a new type of certificate of deposit designed to provide top-rated Japanese banks with broader access to the US money markets The investment banker said its variable money market certificates of deposit are structured as traditional floating rate CDs with the rate based on the AA commercial paper composite rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Shearson said it offered the novel CDs yesterday to mostly institutional investors The series totaled 500 mln dlrs and was oversubscribed with nearly two billion dlrs in bids The first banks to issue the variable money market CDs were Sanwa Bank Ltd Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd Fuji Bank Ltd and Sumitomo Bank Ltd each with tranches of 100 mln dlrs Shearson detailed The investment banking firm said another series of variable money market CDs is planned for April The variable money market CDs provide a low cost dependable source of funds for issuing Japanese banks said Robert Shapiro executive vice president with Shearson Lehman Commercial Paper Inc The instrument enables banks to diversify their funding base in a significant way In yesterday's series the issuing banks' coupon rates were set at the commercial bank composite rate plus a spread which is expected to equal an all-in-cost of LIBOR minus 10 basis points Shearson said The rate will be reset monthly or quarterly and will be subject to a maximum of LIBOR and a minimum of the New York Fed's commercial paper composite rate Shearson stressed however that the spread over the commercial paper index to be paid by an issuing bank will be determined by investor demand It added that other Japanese banks may participate in future issues For the first time they (the banks) will gain access not only to traditional CD investors but also to commercial paper investors at rates which are competitive with traditional floating rate CDs said Michael Balaban a vice president with Shearson's commercial paper unit He added For US investors the CDs are attractive because they are domestically issued paper with competitive rates offered by AAA-rated Japanese banks Balaban noted that several fiduciary investors and money market funds which had never previously purchased Japanese bank paper submitted bids during yesterday's sale Entertainment Corp said it has entered an acquisition and distribution agreement with Tokyo-based Gaga Communications to make and distribute home video titles in Japan under the Prism label Both companies will provide funding for joint acquisitions of up to ten mln dlrs Gaga is a subsidiary of Nihon Tape Corp Japan's largest wholesaler of pre-recorded cassettes Gaga will manufacture and distribute the videos for the Japanese market Co a unit of Rockwell International Corp said it has formed a joint venture with TDK Corp of Tokyo to produce market and sell ferrite magnets Allen-Bradley will be responsible for production and TDK will handle sales and marketing Products will be marketed through TDK Corp of America a Chicago-based TDK unit that markets TDK's electronic components The venture to be known as Allen-Bradley/TDK Magnetics will be based in Shawnee Okla in the existing Allen-Bradley magnetics production facility Life Insurance Co> is pursing a possible link with an American securities house to expand its overseas investment portfolio a company spokesman said But he declined to comment on rumours the company would take a 10 pct stake in <Shearson Lehman Brothers> an investment banking unit of American Express Co <AXP> He said the firm started to sound out several US Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago and was narrowing the number of prospects but he did not say if it had set its sights on one firm Nippon Life Japan's largest life insurer also plans to set up a wholly owned investment unit <Nissei International America> in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada Singapore the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year he said These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put more emphasis on overseas investment management as opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets are growing The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth of US Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm foothold there the spokesman added looks set to continue to provide good returns on investment in most major cities in Asia and Australia this year A poll of property analysts bankers and economists around the region shows better returns are often more likely to come from buying and selling real estate than from rental income In central Tokyo property analysts project commercial land prices will rise this year by 10 to 20 pct after last year's 538 pct jump The main draw for local and foreign investors in Japan is Tokyo where the top price paid for a central commercial property last year was 169000 dlrs a square meter A building in land-poor Singapore recently sold for 3300 dlrs a meter But the analysts said Tokyo rents could level off as supply increases slightly and the strong yen puts prices out of reach of foreign investors Japanese investors spurred by the yen's rise are spending record sums on property abroad partly elsewhere in Asia but in particular in the US Where Japanese investment could double this year to 10 billion dlrs the analysts said The analysts forecast that Hong Kong property prices will rise steadily over the next few years although a surge in construction will limit increases in some areas Property sales have become increasingly popular because in some sectors of the market real estate prices as in several cities in the region have already outpaced rent yields We still see prices creeping up steadily and I don't see why the trend should not continue over the next few months said Gareth Williams a partner of land agent Vigers Hong Kong But he warned investors to bear in mind the political risk linked to the return of the colony to China in 1997 In several other countries analysts predicted at least some rise in property values which in one or two cases such as Thailand could help spark a construction boom Bankers and economists in Bangkok said they expect at least seven pct growth this year in private sector construction as a result of government assistance low mortgage rates and a generally bullish economic outlook Increased confidence in the economy has also improved the outlook for property in Manila after a three-year slump one Philippine developer said Taiwan's property market is also set to turn around after five years in the doldrums according to property developers in Taipei They like counterparts in many of the region's capitals cited low interest rates as a major factor One leading broker said the property market had become an attractive investment in Taiwan noting property development yields of up to 15 pct Jakarta too has plenty of new office towers Construction has helped cut rents to half the levels of the early 1980s though foreigners usually have to rent because of limits on property ownership as in many parts of Asia In contrast Australia's easing of rules on foreign investment in property combined with financial deregulation and a weaker dollar has helped spark overseas interest in the market analysts said But this has not always meant sales What we have seen is an increase in inquiries particularly from Japan but this has yet to show itself in many new deals being done said Allan Farrar executive director (real estate) of Elders IXL Ltd's pastoral group Yields on prime Sydney office buildings average 65 pct and one analyst forecast a 20 pct jump in rents this year after 15 pct rises in each of the past two years customs-cleared trade surplus fell to 189 billion dlrs in the first 10 days of March from a 191 billion surplus a year earlier the Ministry of Finance said The March interim surplus compared with a 170 billion dlr surplus in the same February period FOB exports in the first 10 days of March rose 58 pct from a year earlier to 550 billion dlrs and CIF imports rose 97 pct to 361 billion The average yen/dollar rate used for the statistics was 15367 yen against 18123 a year earlier

Imatron's computerised diagnostic equipment into Japan he said Corp <TDKT> and <Allen-Bradley Co Inc> a Rockwell International Corp <ROK> subsidiary have agreed to set up a joint venture in the US To

magnetics division in Shawnee Oklahoma It targets first-year sales of 30 to 40 mln dlrs which will be marketed by TDK's subsidiary <TDK Corp of America> TDK will own less than 50 pct of the venture the spokesman said without giving other details Osaka Stock Exchange has postponed its planned April 6 launch of a futures contract tied to stock market movements until after parliament considers a bill to cut tax on futures transactions an exchange official said Opposition parties have disrupted all parliamentary proceedings to protest government plans for a new sales tax The bill would reduce the tax to 00125 pct of the transaction value from the current 02 pct the exchange said The Osaka futures contract will be for a package of 50 issues selected from the 225 stocks that make up the Nikkei average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Australian Wheat Board (AWB) expects to sell about 900000 tonnes of wheat to the Japanese Food Agency this year after renewing its annual supply agreement

its stake in BPI to four pct the ceiling for foreign shareholders the official said The bank has also agreed with <Banco Portugues do Atlantico> a state-owned merchant bank in Oporto to exchange information on customers and help accelerate Japanese investment and technological transfers to Portugal he said Finance Ministry approved the banking industry's plan to cut its share in the government bond underwriting syndicate to 738 pct from 74 pct from April 1 to allow six foreign securities firms to participate a ministry spokesman said Local and foreign securities housess may now underwrite 262 pct of 10-year bonds up from 26 pct previously Under a separate agreement Japanese and foreign brokers will allow the latter including the six newcomers to underwrite five pct of the enlarged share up from 119 pct underwriting sources said The six new foreign brokers are <EF Hutton and Co Inc> <Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc> Dresdner Bank AG <DRSDF> <Swiss Bank Corp International Asia Inc> <Sogen Security Corp> and <Swiss Union Philips and Drew Ltd> The syndicate agreed after negotiation in April 1982 that 26 pct of 10-year government bonds should be underwritten by 93 securities firms 17 of them foreign and 74 pct by banks The ministry later approved the arrangement The Finance Ministry is also considering public tender of notes of over four-year maturity adding to the current two three and four-year note auction the ministry official said The ministry has decided to lower the eligibility standard for foreign brokers to participate in government note auctions by abolishing a requirement that participants have current accounts with the bank of Japan the official said A request by four foreign banks to join the bond underwriting syndicate is being considered banking sources said The four are local subsidiaries of Continental Illinois Holding Corp's <CIHN> Belgian unit <Continental Bank SA/NV> Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV <AMROAS> <Canadian

billion won this year 25 to 30 billion next year and 76 billion in 1991 as royalties Most of Goldstar's output due to start in July will be sold in South Korea he said However the Goldstar spokesman said Canon has agreed in principle to buy an unspecified number of cameras for resale in Japan under its own name he said without providing further details In Tokyo a Canon spokesman said that under the agreement Canon would sell facilities components and technology worth 15 billion yen to Goldstar in calendar 1987 and 35 billion in 1988 he said He said Goldstar plans to make 35-mm single-lens reflex cameras and 35-mm compact cameras at an annual rate of 70000 in 1987 and 200000 in 1988 The camera market in South Korea is expected to expand rapidly ahead of the 1988 Olympic Games scheduled to be held there the Canon spokesman said South Korean camera demand rose to 700000 in 1986 from 640000 in 1985 Cameras made with foreign assistance accounted for 65 pct of cameras sold in South Korea he said Minolta Camera Co Ltd <MNLTT> <Asahi Optical Co Ltd> and Nippon Kogaku KK <GAKUT> already assemble 35-mm cameras with South Korean partners Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has imposed a penalty tax on <Fuji Bank Ltd> for alleged improper use of tax-free reserves a bank spokeswoman told She declined to reveal the bank's planned response but another bank official said it has not paid the penalty The bank said in a brief statement it believes that its use of the tax-free reserves is legal Financial institutions can set aside 0003 pct of their risky loans as tax-free reserves Fuji said

pounds at present said Li Sangsu a spokesman for <Unzan Mine Development Co> the venture partner Work will begin on April 3 and the company aims to increase output to 10 tonnes within a decade to pay off Pyongyang's 70 billion yen debt to 30 Japanese companies Li added We expect this mine to be worth about 2000 billion yen in gold deposits he said The mine started in 1896 by a US Company is one of six or seven virtually untapped mines in the Unzan area 94 miles north of Pyongyang Li said Li said modern equipment and advanced technology would increase yields Up to now the mining was done with antiquated methods and basic equipment The gold mine scheme is the latest in a series of moves by North Korea to clear its debts to Japanese creditors Earlier this year Pyongyang tried and failed to pay off part of its debt with several tonnes of fish Ministry of International Trade and Industry will ask Japanese computer microchip makers to further slash output in the second quarter in an effort to save its semiconductor pact with the United States MITI officials said The United States has accused Japan of reneging on the semiconductor pact by failing to stop the flow of cut-price Japanese chips to Asian markets Washington has threatened to take retaliatory action after April 1 The pact agreed last year calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American chips to reduce some of its huge trade surplus MITI anxious to salvage the bilateral agreement has been pressing chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic chip prices and reduce the incentive to export Last month the ministry asked Japanese chip makers to reduce first quarter output by 10 pct To meet that request they had to slash production by 20 pct over the final six weeks of the first quarter If that reduced production level were maintained through to the end of June second quarter output would come in 10 pct below that of the first three months of the year MITI officials who declined to be identified said the ministry has not yet decided on the extent of the second quarter cutback One said that Japanese chip makers are losing ground in Asia to South Korean and US Competition just as markets there are picking up MITI has been criticized privately by some Japanese semiconductor makers for what they see as heavy-handed attempts to ensure the success of the Japan/US Chip pact Life Insurance Co> is pursing a possible link with an American securities house to expand its overseas investment portfolio a company spokesman said But he declined to comment on rumours the company would take a 10 pct stake in <Shearson Lehman Brothers> an investment banking unit of American Express Co <AXP> He said the firm started to sound out several US Investment banks on capital participation about 18 months ago and was narrowing the number of prospects but he did not say if it had set its sights on one firm Nippon Life Japan's largest life insurer also plans to set up a wholly owned investment unit <Nissei International America> in New York next month and subsidiaries in Canada Singapore the Cayman Islands and Jersey this year he said These moves are in line with its long-term strategy to put more emphasis on overseas investment management as opportunities at home are declining while the company's assets are growing The company is especially attracted by the scale and depth of US Money and credit markets and wants to establish a firm foothold there the spokesman added Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has imposed a penalty tax on <Fuji Bank Ltd> for alleged improper use of tax-free reserves a bank spokeswoman told She declined to reveal the bank's planned response but another bank official said it has not paid the penalty The bank said in a brief statement it believes that its use of the tax-free reserves is legal Financial institutions can set aside 0003 pct of their risky loans as tax-free reserves Fuji

year Lending totaled 16120 billion yen Bank Ltd <ANWAT> has agreed to buy a two pct stake in Oporto-based <Banco Portugues de Investmento Sarl> (BPI) Portugal's largest merchant bank a Sanwa official said Sanwa will purchase the shares from International Finance Corp a BPI shareholder and sister organisation of the World Bank for 351 mln yen he said The acquisition will be completed this month as both the Japanese and Portuguse governments are expected to give permission soon This is the first time a Japanese bank has bought a stake in a Portuguese bank Sanwa plans to increase its stake in BPI to four pct the ceiling for foreign shareholders the official said The bank has also agreed with <Banco Portugues do Atlantico> a state-owned merchant bank in Oporto to exchange information on customers and help accelerate Japanese investment and technological transfers to Portugal he said Express Co said it and its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc subsidiary have been holding talks on the possible equity investment in Shearson Lehman by <Nippon Life Insurance Co> of Japan The company said The discussions have led to a general understanding by which Nippon Life would purchase a 13 pct equity investment in Shearson Lehman for approximately 530 mln dlrs and American Express Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life would explore mutually advantageous nonexclusive business and investment opportunities The company said a definitive agreement on the matter is subject to a number of conditions including approval of the American Express board and the Japanese Ministry of Finance The company said its board is scheduled to meet March 27 for its regular monthly sessions American Express said it is continuing to evaluate various courses of action of strategic importance to Shearson Lehman in addition to the possible investment by Nippon Life It said the options range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening further its access to capital The company also said All the courses of action under study reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson Lehman in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies Results of the study which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries were provided to by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent PSE The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged 833 pct over 1979-81 with the European Community at 688 pct and the United States 482 pct For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 958 pct the EC 281 and the US 172 Japan's rice PSE was 688 pct compared to the EC 136 and the US 54 pct the OECD calculations show In coarse grains Japan's subsidies reached 1071 pct compared with 279 pct for the EC and 131 pct for the US Japan's beef subsidy was 549 pct versus 527 pct for the EC and 95 pct for the US OECD concluded For sugar Japan's PSE was 484 pct versus 279 pct in the EC and 131 pct for the US the study shows The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the US EC and Japan the sources said Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD work Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture However the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials familiar with the study said The US Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84 In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD's in part because farm policies in both the US and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81 US officials said For example the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84 at 25 to 49 pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the US now because of increases since 1984 Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation The updated calculations which may take several months to complete are expected to show substantial increases in US subsidy levels for sugar because the US imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry US subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials added of Tokyo Curacao Holdings NV is issuing a 120 mln Canadian dlr eurobond due April 27 1994 with an 8-1/2 pct coupon and priced at

demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate US exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of US export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation he told the Futures Industry Association Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery he said Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners he said recent figures showed Japan's economy grew by about 05 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 Not enough to sustain employment growth However Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies including tax reform I suspect there will be further moves he said Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in US government spending and for resistance to tax increases Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform he said adding that a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored US cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the US trade balance appeared to have abated However he said that sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987 he said Improvements in the US trade balance he said will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present serious adjustment problems for US trading partners Western Europe where manufactures output and employment have been weak promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the US trade balance Sprinkel said He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them Express Co's plan to sell a stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit analysts said American Express earlier said it has a general understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a 13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment in the US brokerage industry by Japanese concerns The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the US firm Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a price of 27 times book value Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the US insider trading scandal closed out February at a market value of 18 times book value American Express was trading today at 78-1/4 off 3/8 For the last several weeks the stock has been strong on rumors of a spinoff of part of Shearson Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly important Tokyo financial markets I think this in all honesty is a preliminary step said Long What you will see probably in the future is American Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and have a public vehicle for Shearson Long said Normally investors do not make a major capital commitment into an illiquid situation he said of Nippon Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in Shearson might be sold to the public They said the firm like other investment banks needs capital to expand globally American express has said the total employees of shearson will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally However that number is substantially lower than growth last year a company spokesman said American Express officials would not comment beyond a statement made this morning That statement however did not close off the possibility of a public offering or other option for Shearson David Anthony a Smith Barney analyst said it is possible Shearson would be partially sold to the public But he believes the firm will digest the Nippon investment first I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with the money they have he said Joan Goodman an analyst with Pershing and Co also said American Express could determine to sell shares to the public In its statement the financial services giant said it is continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to the investment by Nippon American Express said options under study range from expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition to broadening its access to capital American Express also said the options reflect the continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express' worldwide financial services strategy Shearson follows Goldman Sachs and Co in finding a Japanese partner Goldman last year sold a 125 pct stake to Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion Analysts speculated there will be more such matches Those (US brokers) companies have the expertise They don't have the money There's just not enough internal capital growth said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury who follows other US brokerage companies Hanbury said some Japanese companies flush with cash are interested in the expertise of American brokers Those (Japanese) companies have

to 0 to urge Reagan to impose penalties on Japanese high-technology products containing semiconductors in retaliation for what it sees as Japan's violations of the semiconductor pact While the measure does not bind Reagan to any action Senate leaders said its adoption would warn Japan stiffer legislation would be considered if the violations continue We want to send a message to Japan to let it know how the Senate feels about this matter Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd told the Senate Senate Finance Committee chairman Lloyd Bentsen told the Senate the measure was not aimed at retaliation but at correcting Japan's unfair trade practices A key House trade lawmaker Representative Richard Gephardt also announced he would seek to force Japan and other countries with huge trade surpluses to slash their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as the government has decided to compile a 50-day stop-gap budget for the year starting April 1 An opposition boycott over a proposed sales tax has disrupted parliamentary business Miyazawa told a press conference Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is unlikely to take the package to Washington Nakasone hopes to meet President Reagan in late April or early May to prepare for the Venice economic summit in June Asked if he planned to visit the US To attend monetary conferences including International Monetary Fund meetings in early April Miyazawa said he will make a decision carefully on the matter taking into account parliament debate The package is likely to include a record amount of public works spending in the first 1987/88 half Miyazawa said Miyazawa said the provisional budget will total about 8800 billion yen and incorporate a little more than 1800 billion for public works Japan expects the stop-gap budget to help spur the economy Miyazawa said Miyazawa said the Government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will seek the passage of the bills related to the controversial sales tax without any revision Japanese press reports had previously interpretated remarks by a top government official as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that Miyazawa said customs faced with a flood of fake Reebok sneakers from South Korea have turned away some 100000 pairs since last summer Rebook officials said A Ministry of Finance spokesman said officials at the ports of Tokyo Osaka Yokohama and Kobe had begun barring counterfeit footwear but declined to say how many pairs A spokesman for Reebok Japan the local subsidiary of Reebok International <RBK> of Avon Massachussetts said the firm had complained of the influx to the Ministry last July They use our trademark and everything And it's easy to fake our trademark the Reebok spokesman said He said customs had sent back some 100000 pairs to South Korea but the Finance Ministry declined to confirm this Because of various reasons we cannot say how many pairs have been turned away the ministry spokesman said The Reebok spokesman said an unspecified number of fake Reeboks have made it into the country and were being sold at cut-rate prices in Tokyo and Osaka stores They go for about 20 to 30 pct less than the price of genuine Reeboks the spokesman said A pair of real Reeboks sells for about 10000 yen in Japan The government last summer warned stores not to carry the shoes and Reebok has sued two for continuing to sell them he said No action has been taken against the South Korean manufacturers he said Reebok has also found counterfeits from Taiwan and the Philippines aimed at the US Market and fakes from Spain targetted

February continuing a long-running trend International Iron and Steel Institute figures showed Production in the 30 countries which report their figures to it was 69 pct below the February 1986 level at 3203 mln tonnes Output in the United States fell 185 pct to 530 mln tonnes that in Japan 78 pct to 727 mln and that in the European Community 65 pct to 991 mln The figures continue to indicate a switch away from these traditional major producing countries to the more advanced developing countries Brazilian February output rose 92 pct from year-earlier levels to 173 mln tonnes and that in South Korea was up 75 pct at 117 mln tonnes The 30 countries covered by the figures account for about 97 pct of world non-Communist steel production the Institute said death of the world's tropical rain forests could trigger a new debt crisis and social and biological disasters scientists and ecologists involved with the International Tropical Timber Organisation (ITTO) said At stake is the ability of developing nations including Brazil Mexico and the Philippines to service their debts and the loss of trade worth hundreds of billions of dollars in important sectors such as agriculture and pharmaceuticals they said The experts gathering ahead of an ITTO meeting of consumers and producers near Tokyo next week said the problem is already acute The Philippines offers a textbook case of the economic dangers For many third world nations the loss of the forest is not just a loss of resources said Delfin Ganapin a Philippine government consultant on environmental impact In the 1960s we had 16 mln hectares of commercial forest now we have one mln We have only around 10 years of profitable logging left With a 26 billion dlr debt the loss of logging foreign exchange earnings is serious he said About 14 mln Philippine people depend on upland areas that are now denuded and farmers cannot grow crops Government security advisers say that as a direct result the most likely source of revolution in the Philippines is in the upland areas said Ganapin Replanting is uneconomic and replanted tropical hardwoods have less than a 50 pct chance of survival There is no known way to reproduce the wood or the millions of species within No replanting programme has been successful said Almy Hafild from the Indonesian Network for Forest Conservation Ganapin said three billion dlrs would be needed in the next two years alone to save five mln hectares of critically denuded land in the Philippines The experts say that without a major initiative from the development banks the vicious circle will continue with countries cutting more forest to help service short-term debts at the cost of long-term insolvency Yet timber a five billion dlr a year industry is not necessarily the most direct economic product of the forests and nations must be educated in how best to farm them said Peter Kramer World Wildlife Fund (WWF) conservation director There is a four billion dlr annual global trade in the end products of rattan and Brazil nuts earn Brazil 16 mln dlrs a year he said US Pharmacologist Norman Farnsworth has calculated that 25 pct of all US Prescriptions owe their active ingredients to higher plants growing in the forests Deforestation would wipe out the chance of further discoveries and force major corporations to research develop and produce man-made substitutes at a cost which scientists say is incalculable By the year 2000 only 10 developing nations will still be exporting timber from 33 currently and their export earnings will drop from a 1980 peak of 68 billion dlrs to less than two billion a World Bank and UN Sponsored survey said Of the 203 billion dlrs advanced by the World Bank Inter-American African and Asian Development Banks in 1980-84 only 100 mln dlrs went to forestry projects it said WWF statistics show half of the world's tropical forests have vanished since the 1940s Of 2000 mln hectares remaining up to 16 mln are destroyed each year by destructive logging practises and by local farmers Finance Ministry plans to further ease restrictions on large-denomination bank deposits this year and is studying several deregulation plans a ministry official said without elaborating Banking sources told the ministry plans to lower the minimum denomination of money market certificates (MMCs) to 10 mln yen from 20 mln the amount slated to be applied from April 6 The amount is currently 30 mln yen The ministry is also considering shortening the minimum period of free-interest large-lot time deposits to one month from the current three months the sources said The Ministry plans to expand the issue period of certificates of deposits (CDs) to one week to two years from the current one month to one year the sources said They said banks fear the ministry's plans may induce a shift of funds from bank to other financial instruments One official of a major bank said the planned moves were unexpected as deregulation on large deposits was previously expected to have ended with the measures to start in April On April 6 the Ministry is scheduled to lower the minimum time deposit amount to 100 mln yen from the current 300 mln and cut the maximum MMC deposit period to two years from one Agriculture Ministry said it revised its April-June sugar consumption estimate down to 623300 tonnes on a refined basis from 637800 estimated at the end of December It said the estimate for domestically produced sugar supply for the same period was revised to 190400 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 195100 tonnes while imports were revised to 402000 tonnes from the earlier 435800 tonnes It did not revise its sugar consumption estimate of 253 mln tonnes for the 1986/87 sugar year ending September 30 The ministry said the estimate for the 1986/87 year's supply of domestically produced sugar was revised to 881000 tonnes from the earlier estimate of 863000 The estimate for 1986/87 imports was revised to 1642 mln tonnes from an earlier 1645 mln tonnes Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLOAS> said it planned to pool world-wide sales and marketing of electronic test and measuring equipment with US Firm <John Fluke Mfg Co Inc> It said from this autumn Fluke will sell service and distribute Philips test and measuring products in North America and selected markets including China Hong Kong and Japan Philips will cover mainly European markets for Fluke The Dutch company said it will buy a minority equity stake in Fluke and name a board member Its equity holding will not exceed 10 pct Philips said The companies will also explore possible new joint ventures to develop new product lines Philips said It estimated the world-wide market for test and measuring equipment at six billion dlrs in 1986 Fluke had 1986 sales of 209 mln dlrs last year and Philips' turnover on test and measuring gear was of comparable size A Philips spokesman said the world leaders in the field were Hewlett-Packard Co <HWPAS> and Tekronix Inc <TEKN> with the combined operations of Philips and Fluke third leading industrial organisation said it will send its first buying mission to the US Later this year in an effort to reduce the country's trade surplus with Washington A spokesman for the Chinese National Federation of Industries told the mission was part of a broader plan to switch large purchases to the US From Japan The Federation groups all of Taiwan's major industrial associations Last year its members purchased about 45 billion US Dlrs worth of industrial products from Japan and about 18 billion from the US The spokesman said Federation members were now discussing the volume of business they could transfer to America He said they had drawn up a list of about 80 industrial products they would be shopping for in the US During the buying mission in September but he could give no figure on how much would be spent A Board of Foreign Trade official told the government would send two buying missions to America between June and July this year and might send others later Taiwan's trade surplus with the US Rose to a record 136 billion dlrs last year from 102 billion in 1985 US Senate has

their surplus by 10 pct a year for three years economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus international monetary sources said At a meeting this week in Paris senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus they said Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen's sharp rise against the dollar they still tend to surge when growth picks up according to the OECD As a solution the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy they said That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members The United States which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan's fiscal stance joined in the attack he said The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government's forecast of 35 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1 Most independent forecasters including the IMF believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct monetary sources said The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise The yen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently The yen closed here today at 15153 to the dollar Most Japanese politicians including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa are clearly hoping the yen will weaken government officials said At a meeting in Paris last month Britain Canada France Japan the United States and West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels Officials said that wording represented a compromise Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months before it weakens later in the year Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar perhaps by substituting the word recent for current while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar's weaker levels now perhaps by use of the word present they said In the months leading up the February 22 agreement the dollar dropped some 10 yen The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent US Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 187 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the US Currency Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen Officials said there are already signs of that More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad they said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan plans to announce a package of economic measures immediately after the 1987/88 budget passes Parliament The passage of the full budget is expected after May 20 as the government has decided to

as indicating a revision of the tax but the official did not mean that Miyazawa said Agriculture Ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD is still under way and will be completed sometime next month The officials said the study has been inaccurate so far and they said Japan would comment on the final results A report from Washington yesterday said the study has found that Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies The study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries Japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study the agriculture ministry officials said OECD directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid-May One agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years 1979-81 Japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then partly because of tight budgetary policy and foreign currency factors have also changed he said The study is  Unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country such as geography the source said He said it is highly likely that the final study will show Japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world This would increase foreign pressure to open Japan's farm market further but this would have little impact on Japan's agriculture policy he said without giving further details A main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the United States and the European Community but Japan is a major importer he said will liberalize rules restricting their financial institutions' ability to trade foreign financial futures contracts within the next two years Leo Melamed director of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's CME's executive committee said Melamed also the head of Dellsher Investment Co Inc told a press conference yesterday at the Futures Industry Association convention that within the next year or two the Japanese government is going to lift the curtain on their community of users of futures markets Currently government restrictions prevent Japanese citizens from trading futures or options contracts off-shore and converting the profits back into yen according to Richard Heckinger CME's vice president for international marketing In addition Japanese are not allowed to convert yen into dollars for the purpose of trading futures contracts overseas he said Melamed predicted the Nikkei stock average index future -- a price-weighted index future based on 225 Tokyo Stock Exchange issues which is traded on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange and mutually offset at the CME -- would do much better if Japanese financial institutions were able to use it CME is waiting for approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to begin trading the Nikkei stock index future in Chicago We will not do as well with that contract until or unless the Japanese community financial institutions can utilize it in Chicago Melamed said Melamed and Heckinger said they had no firm evidence that Tokyo would liberalize futures trading rules but sensed from Japanese inquiries and visits a readiness to change Next month the CME is to open a Tokyo office to strengthen the exchange's link to Japan The managing director of the office will be Takeo Arakawa formerly of the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Tokyo Melamed said he hoped Arakawa would help the CME maintain a competitive edge when Japan launches financial futures trading Next month the Osaka exchange is set to begin trading a stock index future Heckinger said We are not going to let them (the Japanese) do what they did to the American automobile industry We want to be partners with them Melamed said and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> is resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a change in those plans a company executive said Cable and Wireless which holds a 20 pct stake in one of the two Japanese firms is opposed to plans to reduce its share to three pct in the merged firm director of corporate strategy Jonathan Solomon told reporters That plan put forward by a senior member of the powerful business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the Post and Telecommunications Ministry has caused a storm of protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market Pacific Telesis Group <PACN> of the United States also holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia <International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC) Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US Secretary of State George Schultz have written to the Japanese government about the planned merger A key US Senate committee Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also expressed opposition to the merger he said The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again that it sees no need for two competitors to <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which holds a monopoly on international calls from Japan The ministry has also suggested that foreign shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm In an attempt to hammer out an agreement Solomon today met Fumio Watanabe the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange the merger But the two sides remained deadlocked At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre optic cables between Japan and Alaska to form part of its global network C and W wants to start right away on the project such as application and other procedures said Watanabe who is also chairman of <Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc> The Japanese side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left with the new firm after the merger These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems I told him we are not a colony or something said Watanabe has agreed to drop barriers to American-caught herring and pollock opening the way for shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo He said the Commerce Department estimated US shipments of processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later years There was no immediate assessment of the value of current US shipments but officials said the pact would lift quotas to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms At the same time Yeutter said Washington was temporarily suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the two fish He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement Finance Ministers from the Group of 10 leading western industrialised countries met here to discuss the world debt crisis trade imbalances and currency stability today following last month's Paris monetary accord sources close to the talks said The officials met at the offices of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to discuss broad aspects of world monetary policy in preparation for the IMF's interim committee meeting in Washington in April The talks were the first high-level international review of the monetary situation since the accord last month reached by the US West Germany France Britain Japan and Canada to stabilise world currency markets at around present levels following the 40 pct slide in the dollar since mid-1985 Other countries represented at today's talks were Italy which refused to attend last month's meeting on the grounds that it was being excluded from the real discussions the Netherlands Belgium and Switzerland Many of the officials had met earlier today and yesterday within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to review the slow progress being made in cutting the record 170 billion dlr US Trade deficit and persuading West Germany and Japan to open their economies to more foreign imports Bakelite Co Ltd a Japanese company told the Securities and Exchange Commission it has acquired 325000 shares of Sheldahl Inc or 107 pct of the total outstanding common stock Sumitomo Bakelite said it bought the stock for 49 mln dlrs for investment purposes Under an between Sumitomo Bakelite and Sheldahl as long as its stake is more than five pct Sumitomo said it has preemptive rights for 60 days following notice of issuance of new Sheldahl common stock As long as its stake is over 10 pct it said it is entitled to Sheldahl board representation Bank President Barber Conable said he believed Brazil's decision to suspend foreign debt interest payments is temporary Conable in a wide-ranging television interview to be shown on public broadcasting tomorrow said Brazil now has the attention of its creditors and must come up with a plan designed to reform its economy I think the Brazilians have the attention of many of their creditors but they must come up with a plan that will persuade people that the Brazilian economy is going to be put on a course that will result in some growth Turning to Japan Conable said the role of that country has been increasing in the World Bank and is expected to continue to do so He said that Japan had made an additional 450 mln dlr pledge to the International Development Association an indication that it agrees that it must provide more help in line with its economic position Conable said there was no indication that the Soviet Union was serious about joining the International Monetary Fund and World Bank He said they would have to get convertible currency and open their books and the Soviets don't usually do that United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties President Reagan's trade policy advisory group of which Baldrige is a member will meet on the issue Wednesday I am confident we will see action taken Sen John McCain an Arizona Republican told reporters I am expecting sanctions at least and even more than sanctions Sen Pete Domenici a New Mexico Republican said The senators several congressmen and US semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan's alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry they said Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions Sen Pete Wilson told reporters The clear import of what he said is that there will be Japan can't just say they will comply We think sanctions must be applied for past violations of the agreement the California Republican said The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems Sen James McClure an Idaho Republican said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries But McClure said senators told him There is no doubt dumping is going on based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the US semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market In return the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year's record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep Bob Matsui a California Democrat public prosecutors and police here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of about 15 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered police said The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June 1985 Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet The company established here in 1981 undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7000 employees at its peak in early 1985 Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30000 clients many of them pensioners and housewives before the firm went bankrupt in July 1985 according to lawyers Of them some 18000 clients claimed they could get back neither gold or money suffering an aggregate loss of 150 billion yen local press reports said Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today included Hiroshi Ishikawa 47 former Toyota Shoji president and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list They were suspected of having collaborated with the late Nagano in swindling about 15 billion yen from about 450 people in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before the firm's bankruptcy they said Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint investigation by the public prosecutors and police who had questioned about 3000 of the firm's former employees police sources said long-term banks will soon cut their prime rate now at a record low 55 pct by 02 or 03 percentage point in response to falling secondary market yields on their five-year debentures long-term bankers said The long-term prime rate is customarily set 09 percentage point above the coupon on five-year bank debentures issued by the long-term banks every month The latest bank debentures at 46 pct have met strong end-investor demand on the prospect of further declines in yen interest rates dealers said The current 55

US Super-computers and barriers to US Firms seeking to participate in the eight billion dlr Kansai airport project US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world's three major trading and economic powers -- the EC the US And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT Australian Trade Minister John Dawkins told the reporters bilateral retaliation at the enormous expense of the rest of the world was no way to solve trade disputes New Zealand trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues great progress had been made in preparing for the current round of GATT negotiations which must not be sidetracked The ministers have said they want to maintain the momentum towards fresh negotiations or avert serious trade conflicts Yeutter said the problem with international trade talks was that they tended to get bogged down for years Countries don't get very serious about negotiating until the end of the day which is maybe five or six years in the future He also said he did not consider the new US Congress as protectionist as it was 18 months ago That's a very healthy development he addedIf you asked me about that a year or 18 months ago I would have said that it was terribly protectionist Members of Congress that is the contemplative members of Congress have begun to realise protectionism is not the answer to the 170 billion dlr trade deficit Yeutter said They've also begun to realise that you cannot legislate solutions to a 170 billion dollar trade deficit so they are more realistic and in my judgement more responsible on that issue than they were 12 or 18 months ago He added Whether that will be reflected in the legislation that eventually emerges is another matter vehicle output in February fell 04 pct from a year earlier to 103 mln units for the fifth consecutive monthly year-on-year drop but February output was up 10 pct from a month earlier the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) said February car production totalled 651253 units up 04 pct from a year earlier trucks 375899 down 18 pct and buses 4230 up 103 pct he said Vehicle exports are expected to show a seven pct year-on-year drop in February when figures are announced on March 27 a JAMA spokesman said The JAMA spokesman blamed slow sales to southeast Asia the Mideast and other countries except the US And Europe February motorcycle output fell 329 pct from a year earlier to 224312 the 13th straight year-on-year drop but was up 42 pct from a month earlier he added Motorcycle exports are expected to show a 26 pct year-on-year fall in February he said German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates as seen in last month's Paris pact extend to keeping down European interest rates banking economists said But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany's economy they said The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention economists said Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling US and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant They mark an uncoupling of movements in US and foreign interest rates Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar's fall These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the US not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point to avoid weakening the dollar West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline It's not a taboo Peter Pietsch spokesman for Commerzbank AG said But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year The Bundesbank's average yield of public paper is already nearing last year's low Last week yields fell to around 550 pct not far from the 1986 low of 535 pct posted in mid-April Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank's central bank money stock aggregate But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet US demands for faster West German growth This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak but demand could emerge if rates begin rising Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth and higher than expected spending Josef Koerner chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar's decline long term yields may to have to rise economists said Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn's tax reform package The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 52 billion marks to 144 billion West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform such as raising indirect taxes But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 219 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 148 billion in fourth quarter 1985 The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended his tax reform plans from fierce opposition even within his own party as campaigning for local elections began Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means wrong Unless we reform the system now Japan is bound to decay perhaps within the next 10 years Nakasone told supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide vote since the LDP's general election victory last July Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to fight a proposed five pct sales tax one of the main planks in the tax reform package and are now challenging the LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies In Tokyo incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the sales tax as it stands A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would take the tax which Nakasone proposes to implement next January into consideration when they vote Takako Doi Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party said in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the tax The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax Your vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it) The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with other parties in other prefectures A close aide to Nakasone who asked not to be identified said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local elections since almost all candidates irrespective of party affiliation are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls compound feed output fell to 206 mln tonnes in January from 257 mln in December against 204 mln a year earlier Agriculture Ministry statistics show January sales totalled 207 mln tonnes against 259 mln in December and 204 mln a year earlier while end-month stocks were 233003 tonnes against 230764 and 241567 Base mixes for the January compound feed output included corn sorghum and soybean meal Corn use totalled 993156 tonnes against 120 mln in

informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting that in addition to demand boosting measures adopted last September a comprehensive economic program will be prepared after the 1987/88 budget is approved Hata speaking at the first session of the two-day meeting said agriculture is no exception to the goal of restructuring the economy but did not elaborate Hata said protectionist pressures in the international economy are as strong as ever reflecting financial deficits payment imbalances and serious unemployment in many countries Despite great potential developing economies are still confronted by grave difficulties particularly debt he added The basis for the talks is the GATT ministerial declaration last September in Punta del Este Uruguay and the subsequent trade negotiating plan agreed in Geneva It is essential that we first reaffirm here our commitment to implementing that plan as scheduled Hata said Hata added it is not constructive to speed up negotiations in some areas at the expense of others In order to rebuild the free trade system it is important for each participant to have domestic policies that will serve this end As part of its contribution Japan plans in April to fundamentally improve its generalised system of preferences for industrial and mining products to make Japan's domestic market more open to developing countries he said Corp <MARTT> said it won a 30 mln dlr contract from China to set up a broiler raising and slaughtering plant in Tianjin under a countertrade accord in which payment will be made partly by output from the plant The plant which will be completed by end-1988 will have a capacity of five mln broilers a year most of which will go to China's domestic market a company spokesman said without giving further details The spokesman said Marubeni plans to increase its countertrade with China by helping China set up farm product processing plants and improving its food distribution system Marubeni will also help China develop export markets for farm products he said The company wants to increase its food trade with China to around 200 mln dlrs a year within a few years from 70 mln now he added moderate

Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the US Economy Japan's trade surplus is expected to

a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters If hasty action is taken in the United States it will create very serious problems The Reagan Administration's Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year Under the pact Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports and has threatened to take retaliatory action In an effort to save the agreement MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market We have almost no grey market he said Supply is diminishing To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented MITI called in the president of Japan's largest semiconductor maker NEC Corp <NIPNT> last week he said It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of <Texas Instruments Inc> Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for US Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers The letter was sent today to US Secretary of State George Schultz Treasury Secretary James Baker Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter The four who make up the Economic Policy Council are expected to consider evidence presented by US Chip maker Micron Technology Inc <DRAMO> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices If the United States uses this as proof of dumpingWe will present our rebuttal he said The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI's advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping he said He also called the case strange but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended

buying orders in the market into materials that conduct electricity with minimal resistance could lead to further gains on Tokyo's booming stock market brokers said They said the share prices of companies likely to benefit from the so-called 'superconductors' rose sharply last week after publication of articles about the research in the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun The companies were in the non-ferrous metal electrical and mining sectors But industry analysts said development problems remain and commercial application is still some years away The area clearly has significant applications but it won't be commercially viable for a few years said Thomas Murtha technology analyst with James Capel and Co Industry analysts said the use of superconductors could bring sharp cuts in electricity costs if present problems can be overcome Nikko Securities Co Ltd analyst Shinichi Nakayama said superconductors could have applications in computer circuitry electricity generation and storage and scientific research The superconductors are made of a blend of metals fused in a heat-firing process similar to that used in ceramics Nakayama said Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWST> predicted in an in-house study that by 1990 the worldwide market would be worth 150 billion yen for superconductors used in computers 50 billion for those used in electricity generators and 150 billion for those used in electricity storage The study said that by 1995 there would be trains capable of 500 km an hour hovering on a magnetic field and powered mainly by superconductors One hundred billion yen worth of superconducting material would be needed for such a train The Kawasaki study also said superconductors would be used in nuclear fusion physics but not until the year 2000 Industry analysts said superconductors have no commercial applications at present In laboratory tests the conductor must be cooled by expensive liquid helium or hydrogen before minimum electrical resistance is achieved though liquid nitrogen which is much less expensive has recently also been used successfully they said Despite this investors on Tokyo's stock market have boosted shares of firms related to superconducting materials From the close of trading on March 17 until yesterday's close Mitsubishi Mining and Cement Co Ltd's <MIMIT> share price rose 140 yen to 485 yen In the same period Mitsubishi

superconductor made from a blend of yttrium barium and copper is currently undergoing laboratory tests under a scheme coordinated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the US Over semiconductor trade government officials said At today's Cabinet meeting Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm US Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the US That pact agreed last year after months of negotiations calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of US Semiconductors Senior US Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action Yesterday Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to US Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output In his letter the contents of which were released today Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets In a separate letter sent to senior US Officials MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention if necessary in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations Canada Britain France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 14840 It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates Sumita said The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system he said The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries the Paris statement said Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade issues straining US-Japanese relations would be resolved before the two countries open trade talks in late April We are having high level discussions on them (the issues) within the United StatesThe relationship on some of those is very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to relieve those strains at the earliest possible date he said I am not sure we can wait until late April he added Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the strain between the two countries Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade issues were semiconductors Japanese government unwillingness to allow public entities to buy US Super-computers and the barring of US Firms from the eight billion US Dlr Kansai airport project near Osaka The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle trade barriers in their country I am convinced that they are attempting to move their policies in the right direction The question is how far and how fast Yeutter said dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates senior foreign exchange dealers said Following its fall today to a record 14840 yen dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down the dealers said The recent remark by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement said Koji Kidokoro general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division He said the market interpreted this as indicating the US Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention Kidokoro said Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency They said the central bank bought between one to 15 billion dlrs today including direct purchases through brokers and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the US Central bank in New York Most dealers said they doubted the US Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen If the dollar drops to that low level it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into US Securities which the Americans don't want said Haruya Uehara chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31 But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish This was due to the lacklustre performance of the US Economy the continuing US Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand increase imports and thus reduce its trade surplus The package was expected in April but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the US Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow securities analysts said The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position they said It's part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions said Simon Smithson an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo The investment in Shearson Lehman a growing firm described by some analysts as the top US Retail brokerage will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 902 billion dlrs they said Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan they added The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management market research and consulting on financing Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the world's biggest institutional investor analysts said The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a US Financial firm The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year Since then they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments Last year a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to EF Hutton Group Inc unit EF Hutton and Co's board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman Sachs and Co Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984 But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations he said It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co With a historically high yen and historically low interest rates there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings The typical salaried employee has 733 mln yen in savings reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct he said To stay competitive fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms') diversification Now there's a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management Smithson said Corp <SNET> said it will set up a second wholly-owned subsidiary in Malaysia to make headphones car stereos radios and radiocassettes from early 1988 <Sony Electronics (M) Sdn Bhd> in Penang will have initial capital of about 25 billion yen and provide 1000 jobs Sales worth 10 billion yen are targetted for the year from April 1 1988 mainly to the US And Europe Sony's wholly-owned <Toyo Audio (M) Sdn Bhd> in Penang has made audio products for export to the US And Europe since 1984 Toyo sales were four billion yen in the year to October 31 1986 Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament's Lower House Finance Committee that the US Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates political sources said Asked if the US Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates Miyazawa said yes the sources said Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency reference ranges even if major nations agree on such an idea as it is extremely difficult to set such ranges Motor Co Ltd <SZMTT> is negotiating a joint venture with Hungary to assemble compact cars there following a request from its government the first entry by a Japanese car maker into a Communist country a Suzuki spokesman said The company in which General Motors Corp <GMN> has a 49 pct stake has to set up such projects to avoid cutting component production in Japan Existing overseas vehicle projects are increasing local content and so using fewer Japanese parts the spokesman said Its Indian joint venture <Maruti Udyog Ltd> MUL 26 pct owned by Suzuki will reduce component imports from Japan as it increases local content to 60 pct from the present 40 pct in 1987 the spokesman said The yen's continued rise against the dollar and Japan's self-imposed restrictions on exports to the US And Europe were also to blame for cuts in car component manufacture in Japan he said private sector investment in plant and equipment is expected to grow a real 09 pct in 1987 after an estimated 55 pct rise last year the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd said It said its survey of 1169 companies at the end of February showed that manufacturing industry investment will decline eight pct this year while non-manufacturing will increase 57 pct It did not provide figures for 1986 The bank partly blamed the expected deline in manufacturing investment on the uncertain outlook for demand in those industries The Long-Term Credit Bank also said that steelmaking and shipbuilding companies are putting a squeeze on maintenance and repair costs for their facilities and equipment In non-manufacturing industry growth in investment is expected to be particularly marked in the wholesale and retail store area 124 pct as new department stores and supermarkets are built and old ones are remodelled The Bank though expressed concern at a slowing of corporate investment that would help restructure the Japanese economy and urged government deregulation and other action to offset this Bank of Japan stepped up its dollar buying as it re-entered the market after the midday Tokyo lunch break dealers said They said the bank seemed more determined to support the dollar than it did this morning Several dealers said the central bank intervened this afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen One said it purchased 150 to 200 mln dlrs in the half-hour since the market re-opened after its lunchtime closure Another said the bank still has buying orders in the market of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention if necessary in line with

Kiichi Miyazawa said the time has come for major industrialised nations to take action on exchange rates in line with their agreement last month in Paris In Paris Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to coooperate to hold currency rates around their then current levels Miyazawa would not say what specific measures major nations would take but told reporters the measures had been discussed in Paris The dollar fell to a record low against the yen this morning piercing the 150 yen barrier Asked if major nations were now negotiating on what measures to take Miyazawa said they were not as measures had already been agreed in Paris economy remains sluggish but is beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon the Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet ministers But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future Agency officials said The officials told reporters industrial production down 05 pct in January from December is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 25 pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 07 pct in the previous quarter A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 27 pct the officials said They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels the officials said They predicted exports will increase by 23 pct in the January/March quarter from the October/December quarter But the problem is imports are not expanding said one official Imports fell by 94 pct in February from January Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told Parliament's Lower House Finance Committee that the US Is expected to intervene in the foreign exchange market to stabilise exchange rates political sources said Asked if the US Federal Reserve Board agreed in Paris last month to intervene to stabilise exchange rates Miyazawa said yes the sources said Miyazawa was also quoted as saying that he is sceptical about the effectiveness of currency

dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system he said The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries the Paris statement said sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies dealers and bank economists said The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention one dealer for a German bank said echoing widepread sentiment in the market But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today It was quoted as low as 14840 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the US Currency to decline further The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop Window-dressing operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the US Currency Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical US Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the US Administration to talk the dollar down Suddenly support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared one dealer said The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 15 billion dlrs and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge dealers said Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan Britain Canada France the US And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 180 marks others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 175 marks or if the decline accelerated The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27 when the dollar threatened to fall below 181 marks The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment one dealer said Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done Some said Baker's remarks and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the US And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands a dealer said Another added If the Americans do not get what they want they will push the dollar down regardless of G-6 Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary US Fiscal contraction Citibank said It added Markets should therefore be aware that 180 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 170 marks or even less is expected this year And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report We are looking for a further more gradual fall possibly to 160 marks by the end of the year But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down a senior dealer said strong earthquake registering a preliminary reading of 65 on the Richter scale was felt on the coast northwest of Tokyo today the Central Meteorological Agency said There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries but the agency issued a seismic wave warning on the coast between Niigata Prefecture northwest of Tokyo and Noto Peninsula to the west The epicentre of the tremor was located in the Sea of Japan far off Niigata it said The tremor was felt as far away as Yokohama south of Tokyo and Hamamatsu on the Pacific coast Federal Reserve appears to have intervened in the US foreign exchange market to buy dollars against yen this morning currency dealers said They said the intervention occurred near the dollar's early low of 14850 yen and the US currency subsequently firmed to 14905/15 It closed at 15000/05 on Monday Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Fed's purchases were for its own account or for a customer But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today Street's biggest brokerage firms eager for funds and foreign ties to fuel international expansion are expected to find more partnerships among Japan's cash-rich companies analysts said Yesterday American Express Co's <AXP> board formally approved a linkup with <Nippon Life Insurance Co> for itself and its <Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc> brokerage unit Nippon Life will receive 13 pct of Shearson for 538 mln dlrs Nippon Life's investment in Shearson follows last year's investment by <Sumitomo Bank Ltd> in <Goldman Sachs and Co> Sumitomo paid 500 mln dlrs for 125 pct of the firm There certainly is potential for additional investment or further linkups with other Japanese financial institutions I think the pattern has established itself here and it's reasonable to expect further investment down the road said Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Larry Eckenfelder Speculation of such partnerships spread to other brokerage stocks resulting in rising stock prices in recent sessions The brokerage industry needs capital and the evolution of the value of the yen and the dollar suggests there's going to be a great deal of investment by Japanese firms in the US said another analyst As globalization of the financial markets accelerates Japanese firms are expected to turn their sights on the expertise of the US brokerage industry Competiton to gain a foothold in the important asian market and Europe has also created a craving for more capital by US firms Morgan (Stanley) First Boston Salomon (Brothers) Merrill (Lynch) Those would be the firms more likely to consider hooking up with a Japanese firm and those would be the ones the Japanese would be most interested in Eckenfelder said All of those firms he said have been establishing themselves in Japan While Wall Street views the investment by Nippon favorably there is some underlying concern that Japanese companies may learn enough from their US partners to ultimately pose the same type of competitive threat they have made in electronics and automobiles The difficult issue is what investment really will lead to as markets deregulate Passive investment is an education gathering period Obviously there are regulatory barriers toward exercising management control said Samuel Liss a brokerage industry analyst with Salomon Brothers The Nippon purchase of a stake in Shearson must be approved by US regulators and the Japan Finance Ministry There will also be a public offering for 18 pct of Shearson Nippon and Shearson have already said they would form a joint venture company in London to work on investment advisory asset management and consulting on financing Analysts believe Nippon has willingly paid a premium for its stake but it will also receive warrants for one mln American Express shares and the 13 mln shares in Shearson will be cumulative preferred convertible to common after US regulatory approval is granted American Express has also guaranteed it will retain a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until 1990 American Express and Nippon are also expected to work closely For instance analysts expect it to market the American Express card more actively in Japan with the help of Nippon The key to the deal is not just raising capital for Shearson but forming a strategic alliance with Nippon said Alan Zimmerman of Kidder Peabody and Co American Express stock responded favorably to the announcements climbing 2-1/8 to 79 in active trading today Some analysts believe Nippon is also interested in gaining a foothold in the US market with the help of American Express and Shearson Analysts predicted other Japanese insurers may be eager to follow Nippon Life US insurers have found numerous partners themselves in the brokerage industry For instance Equitable Life Assurance Co owns Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp and Prudential Life Insurance Co owns Prudential-Bache Securities Inc Eckenfelder said Japanese brokerage firms would not be likely acquirors of US firms for the time being although they have often been rumored suitors in the past Last year when Shearson unsuccessfully courted EF Hutton Group <EFH> Japanese firms were also rumored to be willing partners member of the Federal Reserve Board Robert Heller said he wanted to see stronger Japanese demand for American goods What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of American goods Heller said in response to a question about the dollar's weakness in currency markets He told a Heritage Foundation forum I'd be very happy to see that In his formal remarks Heller said he supported the idea of using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting he said Even at previous meetings commodity prices were raised He added I would not expect future meetings to be different from past meetings in that respect Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee The US dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar As a result efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates Bywater president of the International Union of Electronic Workers called on President Reagan to retaliate against Japan for unfair practices in semiconductor trade He said in a statement a crash program was needed in the semiconductor industry to prevent the United States from becoming one of the world's industrial lightweights Bywater's remarks came as the White House Economic Policy Council prepared for a Thursday meeting to decide what sanctions if any should be taken against Japan for alleged violations of a US-Japanese semiconductors agreement The pact agreed to last July called for Tokyo to end selling semiconductors at below cost and to open its home market to US goods In return Washington agreed to forego antidumping duties on Japanese semiconductors But US officials have said that while Japan has stopped dumping in the US market it has not ended third country dumping; nor has it opened its market to US semiconductors Japan yesterday in an effort to ward off US action ordered a cutback in semiconductors production as a way to force prices up and end the dumping Bywater in his statement said he backed a Defense Science Board task force proposal to set up a consortium to develop new electronic products and manufacturing processes and make the US industory more competitive But he added the industry could not wait for legislation to pass and that action was required now to help the depressed electronic industry Bywater said I urge the Reagan Administration to take full and severe action immediately against Japan by invoking the retaliatory steps that are permitted under US law and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's losses today but senior dealers here believe the US currency is headed for a further retreat Although the intervention was widespread dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies Moreover hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline dealers said The market can be bigger than the central banks And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore said a dealer at one major US bank As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the US currency Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar recover to about 14945 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 14820 yen in the Far East But it still failed to regain Monday's US closing level of 15000/05 yen Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 15 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the US via the Federal Reserve Meanwhile there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 14850 yen today Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 187 marks The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the US Japan West Germany Britain France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market For one thing some dealers believed that the Fed's purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the US central bank's own account suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord The Bank of England's action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank reinforcing the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago It's a yen problem more than anything else Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the US limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury's hands behind its back The US cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized Despite official denials some traders still feel the US would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan Indeed US Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the US currency and kicked off the latest retreat The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services The currency market is becoming very political said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future dealers said Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year it won't be enough to help the trade situation much said Bourdain of BankAmerica who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Paul Volcker has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant US firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against US firms abroad He added even Japan against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed has started opening its markets In his letter made available at the Treasury Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks was a problem I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt Volcker said It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries he said Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects For example the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations Volcker said He recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between US treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars this morning possibly around 200 to 300 mln dealers said One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs through brokers and the rest through banks The buying began when the dollar was at about 14960 yen and helped drive the US Currency up to around 150 he said Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push the dollar up above 150 yen But heavy selling at around that level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen dealers said Agriculture Ministry survey has estimated the nation's 1986/87 crop sugar cane output at 214 mln tonnes down from 262 mln a year earlier Ministry officials said the decline was due to bad weather and a reduction in the land under sugar cane this season which totals 34800 hectares down from 35700 in 1985/86 they said Harvesting stretches from December 1986 to April 1987 Japan's final output will be announced at the beginning of June they said Bank of Japan is continuing to intervene in the Tokyo market buying small amounts of dollars to hold the unit above 149 yen brokers said They said the Bank is coming in when the dollar is around 14905/10 yen the same levels as New York's close yesterday and the midday close in Tokyo today Dealers said the Bank of Japan is intervening in the market through both banks and brokers this afternoon The central bank is checking selling orders through banks and placing matching buy orders they said The central bank started to intervene shortly after the market opened here in the afternoon the dealers said of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected economic fundamentals he said current rates almost reflect fundamentals Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to bring about currency stability in line with the Paris agreement which stipulated that they would closely cooperate to that end He repeated the central bank will intervene if necessary adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was likely But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency levels would be considered in line with underlying economic fundamentals In Paris on February 22 Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold currencies around their then current levels Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen yesterday But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments surrounding trade tensions US Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the dollar US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called US/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January Sumita said He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp rise of the yen The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates in line with the Paris accord he added Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MCT> said it will issue a 200 billion yen unsecured convertible bond in the domestic capital market through public placement with Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd Nomura Securities Co Ltd Nikko Securities Co Ltd Daiwa Securities Co Ltd and National Securities Co Ltd as underwriters Coupon and conversion price for the par-priced bond maturing on September 30 1996 will be set before payment on May 2 This issue equals in size a record one by Toyota Motor Corp last December Matsushita's shares closed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange at 1640 yen down 50 from yesterday of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices he said Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy the economy is not likely to slow down much further Sumita said I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment Sumita said Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when they meet next in April Dealers said they expect the six - Britain Canada France Japan the US Amd West Germany - to meet just before the IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9 Finance Ministry has accepted a decision by the securities industry to expand the share of foreign brokers in the 10-year bond underwriting syndicate to 573 pct from 119 pct now a ministry spokesman said Earlier this month the ministry approved a plan to expand the securities industry's share in the syndicate to 262 pct from 26 pct from April to allow six foreign securities firms to participate he said The banks' share in the syndicate will be cut to 738 pct from 74 pct from April Each of the original 17 foreign brokers had a 007 pct share but the securities industry said in a report accepted by the ministry that it decided to raise the share of some foreign firms due to their commitment to the Japanese market Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd will have one pct while SG Warburg and Co Ltd Goldman Sachs International Corp Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd First Boston Corp Merrill Lynch Securities Co and Morgan Stanley and Co Inc will each have 05 pct Vickers da Costa Ltd and Smith Barney Harris Upham International Inc will each have 03 pct Kleinwort Benson Ltd Kidder Peabody and Co Ltd Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc Deutsche Bank AG and WI Carr Sons and Co each get 01 pct Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd Hoare Govett (Far East) Ltd and J Henry Schroeder Bank and Trust Co and the six new syndicate members -- EF Hutton International Inc Shearson Lehman Brothers Asia Inc Dresdner Bank AG Swiss Bank Corp International Asia Inc Sogen Security Corp and Swiss Union Philips and Drew Ltd -- will each have a 007 pct share in the securities industry Steel Corp <NSTCTOK> said it will cut its capital spending by 364 pct to 105 billion yen in the year starting April 1 from a year earlier due to the postponement of furnace improvements <Nisshin Steel Co Ltd> said it will spend 107 billion yen in 1987/88 for rationalisation and facility improvements down from 321 billion a year earlier after completion of large construction projects in 1986/87 But capital spending by Nippon Kokan KK <NKKTTOK> to improve and increase its production facilities will rise to 9490 billion yen from 64 billion the company said Kinzoku Kogyo Co Ltd> (KKK) a Japanese autoparts maker owned 25 pct by Nissan Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> has exchanged a memorandum to acquire over 50 pct of US Autoparts firm <Master-Cast Co> to avoid losses on US Sales caused by the yen's rise against the dollar a KKK spokesman said The final agreement should be signed this year when KKK forms the new company <Alfa K Technology> he said The new firm should supply all the US Major car makers including Ford Motor Co <F> General Motor Corp <GM> and Chrysler Corp <C> he said yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar a leading Japanese businessman said Bumpei Otsuki president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren) told reporters: The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar) The US Economy is not good and as long as the US Economy is not good the US Will put various pressures (on Japan) The yen's level depends on the condition of the US Economy rather than Japan's economy and as long as the American situation is bad the yen will continue to rise he said To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means including holding down wages as much as possible Otsuki said He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand We have to keep wages as low as possible he said He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports Parts of the service sector are also threatened Otsuki said Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries he said It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector he said Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988 leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy he said Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986 The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 25 pct in 1986 the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 14 pct due to the first oil price crisis In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities he said European Community (EC) has failed to agree on a high-technology research program because of opposition from Britain and West Germany diplomats said But Belgian Research Minister Guy Verhofstadt told reporters the two had been given just over a week to end their opposition or risk plunging EC research into a crisis The so-called Framework Program proposed by the EC's Executive Commission was designed to boost research in areas such as computers biotechnology and telecommunications and combat US And Japanese domination in these fields The five-year program was due to start at the beginning of this year but was delayed by calls from Britain France and West Germany for cuts in the proposed budget of 77 billion European Currency Units (Ecus) diplomats said The EC Commission had already cut the budget from 105 billion Ecus but under EC law the program needs the approval of all member states before it can be launched France has withdrawn its objections and backed a new compromise budget proposed by Verhofstadt to trim spending But Britain is continuing its demands for further sharp cuts in the budget West Germany which yesterday appeared to be ready to accept the compromise was also holding back Verhofstadt who chaired the lengthy meeting said he had given the two states until April 3 to withdraw their opposition But if one or both failed to do so the EC would be left without a research program leaving no money for schemes such as the EC's Esprit information technology drive If that happened  There would be a grave crisis in Europe's scientific and research policy Verhofstadt said adding it could mean research teams being disbanded Diplomats said West Germany was close to agreeing to the compromise which would limit new spending to 54 billion Ecus by allowing for cash already set aside for future projects The plan would also set aside at least 16 pct of the 54 billion Ecus for spending after the end of the five-year program they said But Britain still maintained the allocations were much too high Britain's Research Minister Geoffrey Pattie faced a tough fight to convince his government colleagues they should accept an increase in spending beyond the 42 billion Ecu level so far demanded by Britain one diplomat added Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling trading house officials said The officials told MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy It made the request by telephone A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 14998 on January 19 It hit a new record low of 14820 yen yesterday He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall Bank of Japan will sell 300 billion yen of government financing bills tomorrow under a 29-day repurchase accord maturing April 24 to soak up a projected money market surplus market sources said The surplus is estimated at 350 billion yen due mainly to excess bank holdings of yen funds after heavy dollar purchases in the foreign exchange market yesterday money traders said The yield on the bills for sales to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39495 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate for one-month commercial bills and the 458/42 pct yield on one-month certificates of deposit today The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 1900 billion yen money traders said Steel Corp <NSTCT> plans to reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31 1987 from the five yen of 1985/86 a company spokesman said The company estimated parent company current losses at 15 billion yen in 1986/87 including a gain of 95 billion yen from the sale of securities This compares with a 3607 billion yen profit a year earlier Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2150 billion yen down from 2685 billion a year ago Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise and slow world steel demand Nippon is expected to report parent company results in late May Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 2557 mln tonnes down from 2798 mln a year earlier Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output but forecasts for profits and sales

Stock Exchange at 1640 yen down 50 from yesterday Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the United States will not stand idly by and let Japan dominate the world electronics market Baldrige told the Senate Finance Committee the United States would insist Japan open its markets to US products as the US market is open to Japanese products Asked after his testimony if this meant the United States would close its markets to Japan if they did not open theirs Baldrige said I'm not prepared to say that but it certainly would be one of the alternatives studied Baldrige said in his testimony Japan had a closed supercomputer market and a restricted telecommunications market I can only conclude that the common objective of the Japanese government and industry is to dominate the world electronics market Given the importance of this market to US industry in general and our defense base in particular we cannot stand by idly he said He said it was these concerns about national security which led him to express reservations over the proposed acquisition of Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu of Japan Secretary James Baker said the United States and other nations were willing to cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the levels that existed at the time of an international agreement last month Our position with respect to the dollar goes back to the Paris Agreement that the currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic conditions Baker told a Senate committee Baker continued We said further that we and others are willing to cooperate closely to foster stability in exchange rates around those levels He referred to a February agreement by six leading industrial nations to cooperate on monetary matters Baker refused to answer a question whether Japan and Germany had done enough to stimulate their domestic economies for the United States to support the dollar I will not comment because the foreign exchange market reads more or less than is intended in my statements Baker said Baker said that the other signatories recognized that they must carry their share of the load of correcting external imbalances that have hindered the world's economy He cited news reports that Germany would increase a proposed tax cut for 1988 by about five billion marks to stimulate domestic growth Japan also agreed to consider stimulative measures after the Japanese budget was made final Baker said those nations were stimulating their economies in a manner consistent with gains against inflation Semiconductor Industry Association urged the US government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the US-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and should continue until the United States is satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor exports is not what is required America's interests require that agreements be honored and that US industries not bear the burden for the persistent unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to deliver on its commitments the trade group said The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled for Thursday The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers House Banking Committee approved legislation to bar foreign securities firms from designation as primary dealers in US government securities unless the relevant foreign government allows US securities firms the same trading rights The impact of the proposed legislation would be on three Japanese securities firms already doing business in the US an aide to the sponsor of the provision Rep Charles Schumer said Japan would have six months to open its government securities markets to US firms before the ban would start Other foreign firms would meet the test of reciprocal access The legislation was approved as part of a major trade bill which the House will consider next month The bill also has to be considered by the Senate and signed by the president The three Japanese firms are Nomura Securities Co and Daiwa Securities Co which received approval from the US Federal Reserve Board to serve as primary dealers and Aubrey G Lanston Co owned by the Industrial Bank of Japan Schumer a New York Democrat said the Fed would not be allowed to designate any new firms as primary dealers unless their government allows reciprocal access to US companies Both the House and Senate Banking Committees opposed the Fed action on the two Japanese firms Semiconductor Industry Association urged the US government to impose trade sanctions against Japan for violating the US-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as of April 1 and continue until the US is satisfied there is full

dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to foreign-based manufacturers of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures including market intervention to stabilize exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last Six major nations - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased To prevent a resurgence of inflation the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions he said He said the latest discount rate cut to 25 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency's weakness The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension he said Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending

for 1987/88 starting April 1 by the Lower House of Parliament on March 30 the sources said Issue volume is likely to be 1200 to 1400 billion yen against 475 billion in March they said Projected issue price is around par against 9950 for the March bond they said of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said it is in Japan's national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus He told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem To this end Japan and the US Must make medium- and long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue he added Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in line with their agreement in Paris last month government sources said Miyazawa told an Upper House session the six nations -- Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany -- are abiding by the Paris accord The six agreed to cooperate to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels Miyazawa said he wishes to attend a meeting of seven major nations (G-7) expected just before the IMF/World Bank Interim Committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9 The sources quoted Miyazawa as saying Japan is trying to prevent a further rise of the yen Japan is taking the matter seriously he added Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar at about 153 yen the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris talks Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any mention of specific rates would create an unexpected situation possibility that a major earthquake will strike Tokyo causing corporate and financial ruin haunts the worst nightmares of many insurers and bankers polled by The Japanese capital is shaken by hundreds of small tremors every year but last week's biq quake in western Japan which measured 69 on the open-ended Richter scale was a timely reminder that the big one could come at any time Another on Tuesday registering a preliminary 65 on the scale struck the Sea of Japan coast northwest of Tokyo A widely accepted theory by the late seismologist Kawasumi Hiroshi states that major quakes occur in cycles averaging 69 years Tokyo was last laid flat in 1923 by a tremor reading 78 raising the spectre of another within five years Seismic experts at Shizuoka one of three areas near Tokyo considered quake-prone say they expect a major earthquake within the next few years Added to such fears is the fact that no developed nation has suffered a major quake since the far-reaching changes in the last two decades which have bound the global economy into a complex fragile interdependent financial network We are reaching a dangerous time Insurance companies are starting to worry about how to cover the large losses said Hatsuho Narita a manager at the British Insurance Group It's a theme that has worried a lot of people It's difficult to put a figure on it but the impact on all world markets would be considerable Brian Waterhouse a banking expert at brokerage James Capel in Tokyo told What would happen? Consider that Tokyo and its six surrounding prefectures account for up to 40 pct of Japanese gross national product or some six pct of world GNP Some economists believe that in the immediate aftermath of a Tokyo quake the yen would rise against sterling because of the large amount of reinsurance which would fall due in London But it would plunge against other currencies This would worsen the dramatic loss of value in land and assets in the Tokyo area Banks would be left holding hundreds of billions of dollars in worthless mortgages and loans Bankers estimate that 50 to 70 pct of city and regional banks' loan exposure is to smaller business which would most likely lose all in a quake Up to nine pct of their exposure is in housing and consumer loans they said Many smaller banks and some larger ones would go to the wall bankers polled by said The government aware that insurance claims would be huge has set a payout ceiling of 10 mln yen per private house In Tokyo 100 mln yen buys only a very modest residence In addition the insurance industry has formed the Japan Earthquake Reinsurance Co to cover housing to a total of 10 billion dlrs 80 pct of it government-guaranteed However insurers said the industrial sector which has no government backing is a more dangerous risk Japanese insurers said they are finding it increasingly difficult to find reinsurance abroad Overseas firms are now very alert to earthquake insurance risks said Tahashi Kumakiri Foreign Department head at the Japan Non-life Insurance Association Due to limited world insurance capacity the Finance Ministry recommends a coverage limit of 15 to 30 pct of Japanese firms' total insurable value Even so one insurer believes that local firms reinsure up to 80 pct of their quake cover overseas most of it through Lloyds of London Some of this reinsurance is then reinsured again compounding the risks should the money suddenly be called in Foreign entities in Japan are allowed 100 pct quake cover but foreign insurers now set a limit of 60 pct Industrial cover is confidential but official figures show that in fiscal 1985/86 ended March 31 Japan did about half a billion dlrs of overseas reinsurance business in fire cover most of which is quake-related Bankers said the destruction of underlying assets and repatriation of huge amounts of Japanese overseas investment would seriously affect overseas stock and bond markets Japanese institutions buy a net 10 billion dlrs or so of foreign bonds a month much of it US Treasuries and are purchasing more and more US And European stocks The value of foreign holdings of Japanese securities would nosedive Japan would need huge amounts of money over a long period to rebuild which would block out developing nation creditors from existing capital resources the bankers said Loss of central computers would mean billions in lost transactions bankers noted Oil traders said crude prices would plummet as imports fell by up to half from some three mln barrels per day now Motor Corp <MAZTT> has no plans to produce sports cars in the US A company spokesman said A Japanese daily paper said Mazda would switch production of its RX-7 sports car which is popular in the US To the US Over the next three years to minimise losses caused by the yen's rise against the dollar Mazda's wholly owned subsidiary <Mazda Motor Manufacturing (USA) Corp> (MMUC) in Flatrock Michigan is due to start producing Mazda 626 saloon cars from September at an annual rate of 240000 the company said on March 2 One of Ford Motor Co's <F> Japanese distributors <Autorama Inc> said recently it was considering importing the MMUC-manufactured cars The imported cars will all bear Ford name plates but those sold in the US Will carry Mazda insignia Ford will take 60 to 70 pct of the cars produced by MMUC while the rest will be sold through Mazda's own US Sales network the spokesman said Mazda Motor Corp is owned 24 pct by Ford Heavy Industries Ltd <KAWHT> will increase output of motorcycles dune buggies and jet skis to 380000 units in the year starting April 1 from 303000 a year earlier a company spokesman said Exports in 1987/88 are forecast to jump to 335000 from 271000 a year earlier while domestic sales will rise to around 45000 from 32000 he told Of these exports to the US Will rise to 150000 from 120000 a year earlier The company also plans to lift motorcycle production at its wholly owned US Subsidiary <Kawasaki Motor Manufacturing Corp> to 1985/86 levels of 75000 from 67000 in 1986/87 plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system Japanese and US Industry sources said Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers' demands and the cutback  Is too marginal a Housewives Association of Japan official said Despite mounting US Pressure on Japan to open farm markets beef is strictly controlled by the government which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers Under the plan expected to be announced this month the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against 1400 now and the ceiling at 1780 yen against 1820 The standard price of other beef mainly produced from dairy steers is set at 1020 yen against 1090 and the ceiling at 1325 against 1420 Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone The LIPC is allowed to import most beef with the amount set by the government under a quota system When wholesale prices go above the ceiling the LIPC releases its beef stocks both domestic and imported and buys locally produced beef when prices are below But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling Phillip Seng Asian Director of the US Meat Export Federation told the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with European Community prices about half those in Japan But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or US Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs as well as poor operations by the LIPC American meat packers see Japan as a promising market FC Beatty of US Packer John Morrell and Co told the Japan Times beef cuts which sell for 120 to 300 dlrs a pound in the US Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or US

Times beef cuts which sell for 120 to 300 dlrs a pound in the US Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp reduction in intervention prices US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month In 1984 Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9000 tonnes a year until March 31 1988 In 1987/88 the quota will rise to 177000 tonnes from 168000 in 1986/87 ministry officials said adding Japan wants to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's international telecommunications market said it will offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms President of <International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) Nobuo Ito decline to specify what share the firms would take but told they would not participate in its management ITJ and <International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC) in which both Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> and Pacific Telesis Group <PACN> own 20 pct stakes are set to merge into a new entity to compete against <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> (KDD) The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has urged the two rival firms to merge so KDD would have only a single competitor The ministry has also rejected foreign management Japan's law limits foreign ownership of any new international telecommunications entrant to 33 pct so C and W's and Pacific's stakes could be three pct in the merged firm sources said Those seeking to join are General Electric Co <GEN> Ford Motor Co <FN> <Citibank NA> BankAmerica Corp <BACNYSE> <Shearson Lehman Bros Inc> <Saloman Brothers> <Asia Boeing Computer Service> Unisys Corp <UISN> <Societe Generale> and Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGFRA> The merger plan has been criticised for excluding foreign firms from a meaningful position in the market The UK's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher US Secretary of State George Shultz US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have all expressed such opposition Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will draft a reply to the criticism following further discussion a Posts and Ministry official said scientists say they have developed a material which can help detect the killer disease Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Leading Japanese AIDS scientist professor Naoki Yamamoto told he and other scientists working at Yamaguchi University in southern Japan have been testing the material's ability to filter the AIDS virus from blood since last April and produced successful results He said the material a tube made from a cellulose membrane could only be used to diagnose AIDS sufferers and not cure them The share price of Asahi Chemical Company<ASATT> which plans to market the product in about a year's time rose sharply but ended the day only 27 yen higher at 905 yen a share The cellulose tubes which Asahi will market under the name Bemberg Microporous Membrane (BMM) can also separate the virus of the kidney ailment hepatitis and may be applied to diagnosing polio sufferers vice-president of Asahi Chemical R Yumikura said Ashai will supply BMM for research purposes soon Shares of companies even remotely related to the fight against AIDS have risen on the Tokyo stock market since the first Japanese woman died of the disease in Kobe in January monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention dealers said The dollar's fall below 150 yen which follows last month's Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the US Japan West Germany Britain France and Canada is a dramatic reversal of the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza meeting to weaken the dollar they said The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides dealers said Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the United States Japan Britain and West Germany they said Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was no target zone for the dollar The dollar was sold anyway Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment dealers said The intervention backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt has done little but slow the rate of its decline they noted The situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets Dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars This means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand said Koichi Miyazaki deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 14940 against New York's 14930/40 Its record low was 14840 in Tokyo last Tuesday Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention a chief dealer at a US Bank said Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris accord nations particulary the US Will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high US Trade deficit especially with Japan Further pressure from a protectionist US Congress for a lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options they said The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall not to push it back over 150 yen said Tadahiko Nashimoto manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation dealers said Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand they said The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting April 1 dealers said The market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen one dealer said The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen he said Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145 of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said it is in Japan's national interest to make greater efforts to reduce its trade surplus He told business executives the most important issues for the world economy are the correction of international trade imbalances and a solution to the world debt problem To this end Japan and the US Must make medium- and long-term efforts to alter economic structures which have expanded the trade gap between the two nations World economic growth and therefore an expansion of debtor countries' export markets are needed to solve the debt issue he added Bank of Japan was thought to have bought a small amount of dollars at around 14930/40 yen dealers said The dollar fluctuated marginally after the small-scale intervention believed to total several tens of mlns of dlrs they said Large-scale buying by foreign banks or by a life insurance company earlier pushed the dollar upwards they said Trading was not very active and dealers were watching for further central bank intervention to smooth out any sharp movements but underlying dollar sentiment is still bearish Bank president Barber Conable said he was concerned about the state of Brazil's economy and urged the country to come up with a plan soon to put its economic house in order I am very concerned about the Brazilian economy he told reporters after a news conference in Tokyo He said Brazil had caught the attention of the world with its decision last month to stop paying interest on its loans from commercial banks but warned it not to sqaunder the time it gained by failing to come up with a new economic program Brazil's decision jolted the world's financial community as the country is 108 billion dlrs in debt including some 68 billion owed to commercial banks Brazilian Finance Ministry sources said in Brasilia yesterday that the country was preparing a new economic strategy designed to ensure domestic economic growth Despite mounting domestic and overseas pressure Brazil has said repeatedly that it will not go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help in drawing up a new plan for fear that will only throw its economy into recession Conable said the country may be able to get away with not going to the IMF for help but will need an IMF-type economic program if it wants to regain the confidence of lenders Outsiders like the World Bank are reluctant to suggest possible solutions to Brazil's economic problems because of the delicate political situation there he added While the World Bank has a role to play in helping Brazil it canot replace the IMF as an overseer of the economy Conable said He added that the Fund can be very flexible in its dealings with developing countries adjusting its approach to the political realities Brazil still seems willing to talk to the Fund under the annual discussions that all IMF members undertake Conable said adding that this could partially solve the current stalemate During his news conference Conable said the World Bank backed US Treasury Secretary James Baker's Third World debt initiative which calls for stepped up lending to heavily indebted Third World countries adopting economic policies The World Bank believes the Baker initiative is the best approach he said Debt forgiveness is difficult to design in any fair way and also will tend to discourage further investment and development He cited the recent multi-billion dollar debt package for Mexico the Third World's most indebted country after Brazil Will it work? he asked We don't knowBut we think it more likely to work than any of the alternatives suggested Conable who is here to meet government and business leaders expressed confidence that Japan will make increasing use of its huge trade surplus to help developing countries We are quite confident Japan will make an increasing investment in development because of their willingness to support institutions like ours in increasing ways with each passing year he said hundred members of Britain's ruling Conservative Party have signed a motion calling for trade sanctions against Japan to force Tokyo to open its domestic market to British goods The government announced last week that Japan had a 59 billion dlr trade surplus with Britain in 1986 The Department of Trade and Industry said the government was drawing up contingency plans to force Japan into opening up its domestic markets but a spokesman said such moves were very much a last resort Ideas being considered included blocking Japanese companies from trading in Britain and revoking licenses of Japanese operations in the London financial district Assistant Secretary David Mulford said the Paris agreement among leading industrial nations is intended to produce reasonable stability in exchange markets over the next few months He told a Senate Banking subcommittee the Group of Five nations and Canada agreed in Paris to see if there can't be a period of reasonable stability instead of volatility to give time for the committments in Paris to take place Asked by Sen Phil Gramm (R-Tex) whether US intervention was not in fact overvaluing the dollar Mulford replied that the administration judged that after economic adjustments current exchange rates reflect underlying economic fundamentals In particular the stability sought by the nations would allow West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies domestically and the US to cut its budget deficit Mulford said in his testimony He stressed that a further sharp fall in the dollar would hurt the ability of Germany and Japan to boost growth Mulford noted that half of West Germany's economy was affected by international developments He also said increased Japanese domestic growth would result in more US exports to Japan and would not necessarily lead to greater Japanese capital flows to the US as Gramm asserted if Japan reformed its domestic capital market Commenting on the Paris agreement Mulford said I think exchange rates ought to be stabilized so (Germany's and Japan's) efforts can be carried out Mulford rejected Gramm's argument that faster domestic growth in Germany and Japan would result in an even lower dollar Mulford said the administration wanted to achieve a pattern of higher growth overseas as a way of improving the US trade deficit Otherwise he said the trade deficit would be resolved either through a much lower dollar or a US recession both alternatives he termed unacceptable and undesirable Assistant Secretary David Mulford said he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities I do not believe they have up to this time Mulford told a Senate banking subcommittee He said that for the US trade deficit to continue improving in the next two years We need more policy actions across the entire front of US trade relations including Canada and the newly-industrialized countries (NICS) In particular he said efforts by South Korea and Taiwan to strengthen their currencies were still disappointing Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis He noted that Japanese and European imports from Latin nations were significantly smaller than imports into the US He stressed both Germany and Japan must continue to take economic and structural measures to ensure stronger sustained economic growth Nobuo Ito of International Telecom Japan Inc (ITJ) one of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's international telecommunications market said it will offer a stake in the company to 10 foreign firms But he declined to specify what share the firms would take and told they would not participate in its management ITJ and International Digital Communications Planning Inc (IDC) in which both Cable and Wireless Plc and Pacific Telesis Group own 20 pct stakes are set to merge into a new entity to compete against Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd Minister Margaret Thatcher said the UK Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets She told Parliament that the bid by the UK's Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case I wrote to the prime minister of Japan Mr Nakasone on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid I have not yet had a reply We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is Thatcher said Thatcher told Parliament that shortly  We shall have more powers than we have now when for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company seaborne iron ore imports will fall sharply by the year 2000 with declining imports to the EC and Japan only partially offset by increased demand from South East Asia a report by Ocean Shipping Consultants said The report predicts annual world seaborne iron ore imports of 2677 mln tonnes by 2000 versus 3124 mln tonnes in 1985 It estimates that total bulk shipping demand from the iron ore sector will fall by almost 10 pct or 200 billion tonne miles with shipping demand associated with the coking trade down about 17 pct or 130 billion tonne miles The report sees EC imports falling to 917 mln tonnes in 2000 from 1236 mln in 1985 with Japanese imports falling to 89 mln from 1246 mln tonnes Imports to South East Asia are seen rising to 586 mln from 326 mln tonnes in 1985 It predicts that EC steel production will fall to 109 mln tonnes in 2000 from 1357 mln in 1985 with Japanese production falling to 92 mln from 1053 mln South Korea and Taiwan are expected to double their output to 40 mln tonnes with Chinese production increasing by 25 mln tonnes to 80 mln it added Reserve Board governor Robert Heller said that the dollar's current level is appropriate but declined to comment on widespread market reports of concerted central bank intervention this week The dollar is stable again The current level is the appropriate level Heller told reporters after a speech to a meeting of financial services analysts He said last month's six-nation currency accord in Paris did not include target ranges for the dollar in an academic way Heller also said that it was too early to determine whether the parties to the six-nation accord were taking appropriate steps to carry out the longer-term economic adjustments agreed to in Paris Clearly they've not been implemented yet No one expects implementation within a week or two he said Earlier today US Treasury assistant secretary told a Senate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he opposes legislation to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant US firms equal access to their government debt markets In a letter to House Banking Committee chairman Fernand St Germain Volcker warned that it could lead to retaliation against US firms already operating in other countries The committee approved the legislation yesterday They said its impact would be felt only by Japanese firms designated as primary dealers in US government securities since other countries would meet the equal access rule Even Japan at which the proposal seems to be particularly aimed has made a number of advances in opening its market to US firms Volcker said The legislation gives the administration six months to negotiate equal access for US firms in the foreign government securities markets before the ban on foreign dealers in the US would take effect Volcker said more progress could be made by continuing negotiations without adopting the bill's more rigid approach An aide to Rep Charles Schumer the New York Democratic sponsor said it is expected to pass in the House trade bill London equity dealers doubt whether the much publicised flood of Japanese investment into the UK Equity market will be as large as some analysts have forecast There has recently been much speculation that the Japanese would look towards the UK Stock market for investment opportunities on a much larger scale when the new fiscal year begins next month Last October's reorganisation of the stock market known as 'Big Bang' paved the way for greater participation by overseas investors Some analysts believe the Japanese have earmarked massive sums for investment in Europe Both the London and Tokyo markets have moved ahead strongly since the start of this year But London has lagged behind in real terms and therefore is now beginning to look like giving a better return on any funds that are reserved for equity investment Sterling's firmness also means there are profits to be made from the currency turn However many equity dealers polled by think that the Japanese will shy away from London and continue to invest in instruments such as US Government securities Even if they do diversify from their old stamping grounds they will head for the US Equity market before they come to the European stock markets one dealer predicted The Japanese although very aggressive in markets that they know tend to be more conservative in those they don'tEven if they do come to London in a big way they would tend to go more for the fixed interest gilt edged market rather than the more volatile equities he added He also cited the forthcoming UK General election as another factor in keeping Far Eastern money out of the London stock market The Japanese do not like too much uncertainty and a general election creates just the kind that will keep them on the sidelines one trader said There are also doubts whether the Japanese would find the track records of UK Companies strong enough to make them willing to invest heavily Our industrial and manufacturing output may be looking better but it must still look pretty uninspiring to the Japanese one broker said Some market participants however are a little more bullish and do expect more although not a massive amount of Far Eastern funds to come to London in the short term They point out that capital gains on US Bonds a market in which the Japanese are traditionally heavy players have been eroded because of the fall in the US Dollar and this could prompt them to move funds out of the US But even those who are mildly bullish concede that Japanese investors on the London exchange would almost certainly confine themselves to longer term investment in 10 or 15 leading 'blue chip' issues which may include industrial giants such as ICI Hanson Trust British Petroleum Glaxo and Unilever One analyst said he believed if there was such investment in blue chip issues recently privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom could be left out in the cold He said that with an election coming up overseas investors would be worried that a Labour victory would bring a policy of re-nationalisation of such companies The Labour party has in the past said it would do this Some of the recent rise in UK Equities has anticipated an increase in Japanese buying in the near future Honda American Manufacturing Co has exported the first US-built cars ever sold overseas by a foreign-owned auto company a Honda spokesman said The subsidiary of Honda Motor Co Ltd <HMCT> of Japan shipped 200 of its popular Accord cars to Taiwan earlier this month the spokesman said The company might also eventually send US-made cars to Japan he said The automaker said it would not boost its US imports of cars from Japan but instead make up demand for its cars in the US by increasing US production The shipment to Taiwan was part of planned shipments to San-Yan Industries of Taiwan of about 2000 Accords a year Honda said it does not make Accords in Taiwan and is prevented by Taiwanese import restrictions from shipping them there from Japan Those restrictions were loosened this year to allow imports from the United States Previously no imports of foreign-built cars were allowed the spokesman said The Accords were built at Honda's US car and motorcycle production facility at Marysville Ohio Honda in the past has sent motorcycles from Marysville to Europe and Australia and has sent cars to Canada Honda's US output would have to be adjusted to meet changing US demand the spokesman said He quoted American Honda president Tetsuo Chino as saying Honda will not increase US imports beyond the current level even if voluntary export restrictions on Japanese cars are lifted Analysts say there are few signs Japan's restrictions will be lifted Honda might decide by the end of this year whether to expand its US production the spokesman said Honda said it is considering building either of its two new luxury models--the Legend or Integra--in the United States The Legend and Integra two models of the company's Acura line were introduced last March If the cars prove popular enough one of them could be built at the Ohio plant or at a new factory the spokesman said The spokesman said it is possible Acuras built in the United States could be shipped back to Japan However he said that decision has not yet been made and would follow the decision to build the cars in the United States If demand for either one of the two cars reaches 100000 vehicles a year Honda could decide to build the cars in the US the company said Sales of the Integra through February have outpaced the Legend--35768 against 29824--but the spokesman said Honda expects sales to lean more heavily toward Legend this year because a two-door Legend has been added to the line sales of 2806300 tonnes in the week ended March 19 were the highest level since mid-November 1979 the US Agriculture Department said The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity with purchases of 14 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported under the daily reporting system) Other large increaes were posted for Japan and unknown destinations it said Taiwan purchased 296300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and 170000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season it said Wheat sales of 317200 tonnes for the current season and 125000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third from the preceding week and the four-week average Wheat sales to China of 60000 tonnes were switched from 1986/87 to the 1987/88 season it noted Soybean sales of 483100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior week and two-thirds above the four-week average Japan the Netherlands Mexico and Portugal were the main buyers the department said Soybean cake and meal sales of 289400 tonnes were two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the marketing year with Venezuela the dominant purchaser Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 4400 tonnes as reductions for unknown destinations more than offset increases for Canada the Dominican Republic and Panama the department said Cotton sales of 57900 running bales -- 43800 bales for the current year and 14200 bales for the 1987/88 season -- were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the four-week average Turkey Thailand South Korea and Canada were the major buyers for the current season while Thailand Britain and Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season the department said Sorghum sales of 178800 tonnes were two-thirds above the prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average Venezuela was the leading buyer it said Sales of 41800 tonnes of barley were 10 times the previous week and 10 pct greater than the four-week average Israel Cyprus and Saudi Arabia were the main buyers it said White House Economic Policy Council made a recommendation to President Reagan whether to retaliate against Japan for alleged unfair practices in semiconductor trade US officials said They would not disclose the council's recommendation but the officials said earlier it was likely the council would call for retaliation and urge that curbs be imposed on Japanese exports to the United States The officials said it might be several days before Reagan would act and his moves made public The Senate last week unanimously called on Reagan to impose penalities on Japanese exports Retaliation was also called for by the semiconductor industry and its chief trade union both hard hit by Japanese semiconductor trade In a pact last summer Japan summer agreed to stop dumping its semiconductors at less than cost in the United States and other nations and to open its own market to the US products In return the United States agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments US officials say that while Japan has stopped dumping semiconductors on the American market they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the US semiconductors semiconductors on the American market they have continued to dump them in third countries and that the Japanese market has remained all but closed to the US semiconductors United States' emphasis on its foreign trade deficit is misplaced and the country's real problem lies in its large federal budget deficit the General Agreeement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) said By stressing its record trade deficit of 1698 billion dlrs last year the US Was fuelling protectionist pressure which threatens the world trading system it said in an annual report The fundamental problem the size of the US Federal budget deficit could be remedied only by cutting government spending or encouraging personal savings to finance the debt it said GATT also predicted world trade would grow by only 25 pct in 1987 -- a full percentage point lower than in each of the previous two years GATT experts urged Washington to resist protectionism and instead seek macroeconomic changes to reduce the current account payments deficit -- higher private savings lower investment and a smaller federal budget deficit Raising US Trade barriers would result in little or no reduction in the current account deficit It would however increase inflation and reduce world trade it said The basic cause -- some combination of insufficient domestic savings and an excessive budget deficit -- would remain the report said GATT economists said trade expansion would slow this year because of slower growth forecasts in Japan and some West European nations as they adjust production and workforces to a low dollar risk of higher US Inflation concerns over Third World debt management and looming protectionism The report also said imbalances in the current accounts of Japan West Germany and the US Had increased in 1986 The most likely explanation was that exchange rate changes were not backed by changes in macroeconomic policies it added Thus the prediction that these imbalances would be reduced as a result of the major realignment of exchange rates was not borne out last year the report said GATT warned there was a risk of a sizeable increase in the US Inflation rate under the combined impact of a rapidly expanding money supply and low dollar Such a development could worsen the business climate by increasing uncertainty and pushing up interest rates which in turn would adversely affect world trade But the report noted a surprising rise in imports to the United States despite the dollar's depreciation which makes foreign products more expensive It suggested that resources idle in the US Both human and in underutilised factories were not geared to produce the goods and services sought from abroad World trade in manufactures grew by only three pct in 1986 about half of the rate of the previous year Trade in agricultural goods expanded by just one pct continuing a stagnant pattern in that sector this decade GATT said Developing countries' exports declined significantly while their imports increased moderately although full statistics are not available yet GATT said The combined export earnings of 16 major indebted nations were sharply lower and only five of them (Chile Colombia Philippines South Korea and Thailand) had higher exports Bank of Japan will sell today 400 billion yen of government financing bills in a 24-day repurchase agreement due April 20 to soak up a projected money market surplus money traders said The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 39505 pct against the 39375 pct discount rate on one-month commercial bills and the 450/37 pct yield on one-month certificates of deposit today Today's surplus is seen at 480 billion yen mainly excess bank holdings due to big Bank of Japan dollar purchases on March 25 Outstanding bills will total some 2300 billion yen consumer price index (base 1985) was unchanged at 997 in February from a month earlier the government's Management and Coodination Agency said The index showed a 04 pct drop in January The February index was down one pct from a year earlier for the third consecutive year-on-year drop In January the index fell 11 pct from a year earlier the first drop of over one pct since a 13 pct drop in September 1958 In February petrol prices increased but winter clothing prices stayed low and vegetable prices fell The February year on year fall was due to lower vegetable fuel oil petrol electricity and gas prices and despite higher housing education footwear and clothing costs The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area (base 1985) in mid-March rose 04 pct from a month earlier to 1006 reflecting higher vegetable prices The index fell 03 pct year on year the third consecutive yearly drop reflecting lower food and utility costs White House Economic Policy Council decided to recommend trade sanctions against Japan for violations of the US-Japanese semiconductor agreement industry sources said They would give no details noting that the White House had not commented on the decision The administration has been under pressure to retaliate There was no immediate announcement on the council's decision but US Officials said it was likely the senior policy group's move on curbs reflected growing American frustration over alleged unfair Japanese trade practices US Officials said President Reagan would probably act on the recommendations in a day or so after consulting with aides on the foreign policy implications of retaliation The officials said Reagan might delay retaliation for a last try to persuade Japan to abide by the agreement reached last July governing trade in semiconductors Under a pact reached last July Japan was to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its own market to US-made semiconductors In return the US Agreed to hold up imposing anti-dumping duties on Japanese semiconductor shipments The United States said that dumping has stopped in the US Market but has continued in third countries and that the Japanese market remains closed The pressure on Reagan to retaliate included a unanimous call by the Senate last week to impose penalties on Japanese high technology products containing semiconductors A call for retaliation also came from the semiconductor industry and from its chief trade union US Officials said the most likely move against Japan would involve duties on semiconductor-based goods such as televisions video cassette recorders and computers Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will make an official week-long visit to the United States from April 29 and hold talks in Washington with President Reagan Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda told reporters Government sources said Nakasone would try to resolve growing bilateral trade friction and discuss the June Venice summit of Western industrial democracies Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari will accompany Nakasone ministry officials said US Industry sources in Washington said the White House Economic Policy Council was recommending trade sanctions against Japan for violating the two countries' agreement on semiconductor trade Under the pact Japan pledged to stop dumping microchips in the US And Asia and open its domestic market to US Semiconductors Telegraph and Telephone Co> (NTT) is considering buying a Cray II supercomputer worth some three billion yen from Cray Research Inc <CYR> and a decision is expected in early April an NTT official said He told NTT was considering the Cray machine because of its superior operational speed and memory capacity and not because of any pressure to buy foreign hardware Industry sources said foreign frustration was growing over lack of access to Japan's semiconductor and telecommunications markets and Washington had criticised Japanese government agencies for not buying US Supercomputers finance ministry appears ready to allow Japanese financial institutions to use overseas financial futures markets a ministry official said He declined to say when but banking sources expect approval as early as April Banks securities houses and insurance companies are expected to become eligible to deal in deposit interest rate bond and stock index futures Ministry officials said they are wary of giving permission to individuals or corporations because of their relative inexperience Broking for Japanese residents by financial institutions would be prohibited as securities exchange laws bar banks from doing this the banking sources said Overseas subsidiaries and branches of Japanese banks and securities houses have already been allowed to use the overseas futures markets on their own accounts The Finance Ministry Ordinance based on Foreign Exchange Administration Law will have to be revised to allow local institutions to join the overseas markets a ministry official said Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has told his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with a draft economic package in early April in time for his visit to Washington starting on April 29 government officials said Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) to work closer with the LDP to work out a full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six industrial countries the officials told The date for the government to announce its package based on the LDP's suggested measures is not yet known but it may be before the fiscal 1987 budget passes the Parliament around late May the officials said The government has said in the past the package should come after the passage of the budget But calls have grown at home and abroad for the government to announce it earlier as budget debates have been stalled by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business in protest at a planned five pct sales tax EPA chief Tetsuo Kondo told a press conference he sees a need to work on the economic plan early although the government's stance on the date for the plan remains the same an EPA spokesman said Projected measures include promoting house construction infrastructure and urban development he quoted Kondo as saying Under last month's Paris currency agreement Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic plan to stimulate domestic demand increase imports and so help reduce its huge trade surplus The government announced today Nakasone will visit Washington on April 29 for a week to discuss bilateral issues including the trade imbalance with President Reagan and other officials Finance Ministry is expected to introduce yen commercial paper CP from October 1 in response to growing calls from corporations ministry sources said Around 200 corporations satisfy financial standards set by securities houses for non-collateral straight bond issues including electric power companies <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> and Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd securities managers said Most eligible firms would have to set up special reserves for CP issues called backup lines or be guaranteed by financial institutions to protect investors they said The legal status of yen CP would be the same as yen commercial bills and it would be placed by an intermediary bank or securities house securities managers said The minimum issue unit will be 100 mln yen and maturities will be from 30 days and six months they said Securities houses banks insurance companies and consumer credit companies are barred from CP issues they said Only banks may be commissioned to handle the clerical business of principle payments they added major Japanese steelmakers plan to form a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than the US And the European Community for a year from April to keep prices above output costs company officials involved said The companies are Nippon steel Corp <NSTCT> Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd <SMITT> Nippon Kokan KK <NKKTT> and Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWST> which together account for some 95 pct of Japan's total seamless pipe exports The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected later this month the officials said Under the plan the four companies will set floor prices for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar reduced world demand caused by lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in price-cutting competition the officials said In calendar 1986 seamless pipe exports fell to 234 mln tonnes from 299 mln in 1985 and 312 mln in 1981 The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices saying it depends partly on volume but industry sources estimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct to some 800 dlrs a tonne president of Japan's biggest high technology firm NEC Corp <NIPNT> is anything but worried despite growing anti-Japanese protectionism a soaring yen and a stagnant world electronics market The company's structure was developed by looking ahead Tadahiro Sekimoto told in an interview We assumed the era of a strong yen trade friction and globalisation would arrive and we moved ahead on that basis There's no need to change our strategy now However the world's largest manufacturer of microchips the tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most high technology products knows it must keep looking ahead if it is to survive Hoping to build on existing strengths NEC is now turning its focus on home electronics an area of past weakness Sekimoto said NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan C and C (Computers and Communications) to create high level home electronics that go beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders Sekimoto said Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC's total 233467 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in the year ended March 31 1986 Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be a major growth market in the future but some warn the company faces some stiff competition This is where the market is going to be for a long time -- in products that combine personal computers video display and telecommunications networks said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec But Matsushita (Electric Industrial Co Ltd) may be there first But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carry the day Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchips or telecommunications but none is in the top 10 in all three NEC is unique in that respect he said To help its already high rankings NEC will further increase the high level of offshore production which makes it one of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms The company will increase offshore output of all goods it sells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the next several years Sekimoto said But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas despite moving last year to become joint owner along with France's Cie des Machines Bull <BULPP> of US Firm Honeywell Inc's <HON> Information Systems unit We hope to increase our share in the US Market through the Honeywell tie-up But our basic strategy is to take an independent and autonomous route said Sekimoto The company also plans to maintain its independent line by continuing to make computers which are not compatible with those of International Business Machines Corp <IBM> he said Among the Japanese competitors only NEC hasn't been caught in software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits and market share have gradually expanded Sekimoto said Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers are perfected IBM compatibility will be irrelevant What will matter is the best hardware the best software and the best ability to meet customers needs Sekimoto said In fact NEC which has over half of Japan's personal computer market may go to court to stop competitors selling cheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringe copyright on its operating system an NEC spokesman said While industry analysts give NEC high marks for looking ahead they note that it failed in forecasting microchip demand Like other Japanese chipmakers the firm was left with serious excess capacity when lean years followed the boom times But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment in the sector Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spending again if only slightly We're not going to increase production But we are going to invest in new product development and upgrade existing plant he said Despite NEC's admitted strengths analysts note the company faces tough times due to stagnant markets NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology but they are caught in a downturn which may last a long time said Salamon's Ryavec The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent net profits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31 1987 down 43 pct from the previous year although sales are expected to rise eight pct to 2130 billion yen Profits will improve only slightly next year rising to 38 billion yen on sales of 2350 billion it said government adopted an 8829 billion yen stop-gap budget for fiscal 1987 starting April 1 to compensate for the delay in the passage through the Parliament of the full 1987/88 budget The provisional budget includes 1862 billion yen in public works spending to help stimulate the economy and meet overseas demand for Japan to import more and reduce its huge trade surplus officials said They said the stop-gap budget will be in effect for 50 days through May 20 and is the largest ever The budget includes 1580 billion yen in new government bond issues Officials said the spending on public works accounts for about two-sevenths of the 6017 billion yen in public works outlay set aside in the pending formal 1987/88 budget The planned full budget totals 54101 billion yen The government had to work out the stop-gap budget because budget debates have been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business in protest against a planned five pct sales tax industrial production index (base 1980) rose 03 pct to a seasonally adjusted 1227 in February from the previous month the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Output fell 05 pct in January from a month earlier The preliminary unadjusted February index rose 06 pct from a year earlier after a 05 pct year-on-year rise in January The adjusted February producers' shipment index (base 1980) rose 07 pct to 1185 from January when it fell 07 pct from December The unadjusted shipment index rose 14 pct from a year earlier after a 10 pct year-on-year January gain The adjusted February index of producers' finished goods (base 1980) fell 13 pct to 1045 from January when it fell 03 pct from December The unadjusted index fell 35 pct from a year earlier after a 23 pct year-on-year drop in January A 27 pct rise by the electronics industry on higher output of facsimile machines and video tape recorders was a major contributor to the rise in February industrial output though car production fell from January The official said industrial production is expected to rise 32 pct in March on higher production by machinery steel and chemical makers but will drop 34 pct in April on a downturn in the output of those industries He gave no further details Tokyo Medical College group said it had developed a five-minute method that may be the world's fastest way of screening people for the AIDS virus Lecturer Junko Renard told a meeting of the Japan Blood Transfusion Society new Latex Particle Agglutination Test used a light meter to identify acquired immune deficiency syndrome in blood mixed with a reagent and a latex rubber compound State officials said Japan will step up its anti-AIDS campaign with 340000 posters and a telephone counselling service in 21 cities this month It will also hand out 90000 books on AIDS diagnosis to hospitals and clinics received in February by 50 major Japanese construction firms rose 27

February from the private sector rose 170 pct from a year earlier to 61426 billion yen for the fourth consecutive year-on-year rise This comes after a 373 pct rise in January from a year earlier to a downward revised 59809 billion The February increase over a year earlier reflected a 239 pct rise in orders from non-manufacturing industries absorbing a 108 pct drop in those from manufacturers Public sector orders fell 178 pct from a year earlier to 18354 billion yen There was an 114 pct year-on-year rise to 16074 billion in January Foreign orders were 2008 billion yen down 477 pct from a year before after a 699 pct drop to an upward revised 4361 billion in January Orders below 10 mln yen fell 277 pct from a year earlier to 2380 billion yen This was after a 59 pct decline to an upward revised 2481 billion in January current account surplus rose to 738 billion dlrs in February from 389 billion a year ago and from 495 billion in January the Finance Ministry said The trade surplus rose to 814 billion dlrs in February from 477 billion a year earlier and 570 billion in January The long-term capital account deficit widened to 1140 billion dlrs from 806 billion a year ago but it narrowed from 1232 billion in January the Ministry said Japan's February exports rose to 1674 billion dlrs from 1489 billion in February 1986 and from 1465 billion in January the Ministry said Imports fell to 861 billion from 1012 billion a year earlier and 894 billion in January The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 402 billion dlrs from 417 billion in February 1986 and 737 billion in January Short-term capital account payments swung to a 128 billion dlr deficit in February from a 160 billion surplus a year earlier and a 144 billion dlr surplus in January Errors and omissions were 265 billion dlrs in surplus compared with a 127 billion surplus a year earlier and a 110 billion deficit in January The overall balance of payments deficit rose to 265 billion dlrs from 130 billion a year earlier but was down from 704 billion in January The seasonally adjusted trade surplus fell to 916 billion dlrs in February from the record 958 billion in January the Ministry said The seasonally adjusted current account surplus also dropped to 84 billion dlrs in February from the record 883 billion set in January store and supermarket sales in February rose 37 pct from a year earlier to 1080 billion yen after a 26 pct year-on-year gain in January boosted by higher sales of clothes and food at department stores the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said The unadjusted total included department store sales of 559 billion yen up 51 pct from a year earlier and supermarket sales of 521 billion up 24 pct The seasonally adjusted store sales index (base 1985) fell 15 pct to a preliminary 1067 in February from 1083 in January compared with 1029 a year earlier 50-day provisional 1987/88 budget adopted today by the government allows the Finance Ministry to issue up to 14600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund financing bills government sources said Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used to buy dollars to prevent a further dollar fall The government sources said the amount covering the first 50 days of the year starting April 1 accounts for more than 90 pct of the 16000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full budget net purchases of foreign stocks jumped to a near-record 152 billion dlrs in February from 113 mln in January the Finance Ministry said Net buying hit a record 155 billion dlrs last December Gross purchases of foreign stocks rose to 448 billion dlrs in February

dlrs in February from 1046 billion in January the ministry said The ministry said gross purchases of foreign bonds were 11553 billion dlrs in February down from 11804 billion in January while foreign bond sales fell to 10612 billion from 10758 billion Foreign investors sold a net 427 mln dlrs of Japanese bonds excluding bills after buying 227 mln dlrs in January They took a gross 2659 billion dlrs

mln krone in <Danish Dairy Farms Ltd> and will jointly market its produce from April The company was set up last year by three major Danish livestock cooperative federations to expand markets for their dairy products a Mitsubishi official said This is the first time a Japanese trading house has traded non-Japanese dairy products in the world market he said He said Mitsubishi expects the Danish company's annual sales to be 10 billion yen in its first year from April 1 has sought to assure the US It is not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese international telecommunications company below the legal limit of 33 pct a Post and Telecommunications ministry official said In a letter sent yesterday Postal Minister Shunjiro Karasawa told US Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the ministry does not object to foreign participation by those US Firms that have expressed interest But it does oppose any foreign international telecommunications carrier having a management role he said The move appears to be an effort to dampen US Opposition to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete with the current monopoly <Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd> and to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by UK's Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> industry analysts and diplomats said One of the rival firms <International Telecom Japan Inc> (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight US Firms including General Electric Co <GE> Ford Motor Co <F> and Citibank NA <CCI) and two European companies ITJ president Nobuo Ito said yesterday Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second potential KDD rival <International Digital Communications Planning Inc> along with <C Itoh and Co> Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc <PAC> both of the US Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the merger of the two firms because it says the market can only support a single KDD competitor It has also rejected management participation by an international common carrier such as Cable and Wireless arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy Jonathan Solomon yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20 pct the ministry official said Channeling the US Firms into a single merged competitor would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless' share industry analysts said Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one combined competitor Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst Darrell Whitten said Political  Leverage may get the total foreign share up to a certain amount but you won't find any one company with an extraordinarily large holding Whitten said Western diplomatic sources were more blunt They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of strategies to reduce that share one said Fumio Watanabe a senior Keidanren (a leading business organization) official who has been trying to arrange the merger will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday the ministry official said Steel Corp <KAWST> said its parent company's capital spending in the year from April 1 will fall to 75 billion yen from 110 billion in the current year and Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd <SMITT> said its capital spending will drop to 70 billion yen from 85 billion Both companies said they do not plan to start new large construction projects linked to production increases in the coming year because of the yen's appreciation and slow world steel demand aluminium output fell to 5298 tonnes in February from 7472 in January and 14280 a year earlier preliminary International Trade and Industry Ministry figures show Output fell sharply from a year ago as most aluminium firms stopped smelting in the past year due to cheap imports industry sources said Sales and end-month stocks in tonnes were: Feb 87 Jan 87 Feb 86 Sales 36557 38678 75687 Stocks 53248 56620 127083 primary aluminium imports rose to 98170 tonnes in February from 91157 in January and 94926 a year earlier the Japan Aluminium Federation said This brought total imports in 1986/87 ending March 31 to 109 mln tonnes against 125 mln a year earlier The February total included 19102 tonnes from the US Against 16577 in January and 9933 a year ago 24391 from Australia against 19585 and 21208 and 12611 from Indonesia against 5891 and 16601 Tokyo Stock Exchange said it will shorten the trading session for stocks and convertible bonds by 30 minutes from March 30 to cope with high volume and will maintain the cut as long as excessive trading continues Stock turnover hit a record 26 billion shares today exceeding the previous peak of 24 billion set on March 18 Afternoon trading will start at 1330 local time (0430 GMT) instead of the current 1300 (0400) today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 814 billion dlrs in February from 57 billion in January and 477 billion a year ago The current account surplus which includes trade in services as well as goods climbed to 738 billion dlrs last month from 495 billion in January and 389 billion a year ago After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations the figures look a bit better but not much On that basis the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 916 billion dlrs from a record 958 billion in January In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength said William Stirling economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper On a seasonally adjusted basis we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down Jardine's Rasmussen said But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish he said Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the US Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports they said But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japan's trading partners Bank President Barber Conable called on Japan to boost investment in developing nations for its own sake as well as that of the world economy Japan has the means to make a major contribution to development in the Third World he told about 500 Japanese businessmen and academics I would be pleased with additional support With 25 pct of the world's total banking assets Japan could do more to help assist indebted Third World countries develop roads bridges and other infrastructure he said Conable said additional commercial bank investment would also be to Japan's advantage It would profit from rechannelling its huge trade surplus into Third World economies -- notably those in South America China and India -- that are likely to expand faster than those in the developed world he said Japan is now the second largest shareholder in the Bank's concessionary lending affiliate the International Development Association (IDA) It has also agreed recently to expand its contribution to another affiliate the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Conable noted Conable said the World Bank was expanding its structural adjustment loans designed to encourage developing countries to open their economies more to free competition and trade Adjustment loans could rise to 30 pct (of total World Bank loans) in the near future though maybe not this year Conable told after his speech Such loans currently account for slightly over 20 pct Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will make an official week-long visit to the United States from April 29 and hold talks in Washington with President Reagan Chief Cabinet Secretary Masaharu Gotoda told reporters Government sources said Nakasone would try to resolve growing bilateral trade friction and discuss the June Venice summit of Western industrial democracies Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari will accompany Nakasone ministry officials said US Industry sources in Washington said the White House Economic Policy Council was recommending trade sanctions against Japan for violating the two countries' agreement on semiconductor trade Under the pact Japan pledged to stop dumping microchips in the US And Asia and open its domestic market to US Semiconductors Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will visit Washington next month in a bid to defuse mounting US Anger over Japanese trade policies but Western diplomats said they believed his chances of success were slim Boxed in by powerful political pressure groups and widespread opposition to his tax reform plans Nakasone will be hard-pressed to come up with anything new to tell US President Ronald Reagan and key US Congressmen they said News of the week-long visit starting April 29 coincided with news that Japan recorded a 814 billion dlr trade surplus last month more than 70 pct higher than a year earlier It also came one day after the Reagan Administration's Economic Policy Council decided to take retaliatory action against Japan for its alleged failure to live up to a joint trade agreement on computer microchips Nakasone wants to go armed with two separate packages - one designed to pep up Japan's sagging economy and imports in the short-term the other to redirect the country in the medium term away from its over-dependence on exports for growth But government officials said political infighting could rob both packages of much of their punch and might even prevent one from seeing the light of day Nakasone has insisted that the government would not draw up a package of short-term economic measures until after its 1987/88 budget passed parliament because he feared that would amount to a tacit admission that the budget was inadequate But his hopes for quick passage of the budget in time for his trip have been shattered by a parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting over the sales tax plan Faced with the possibility that he might have to go to the US Virtually empty-handed Nakasone today ordered his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with its own measures He can then tell Reagan the LDP package will form the basis of the government's plans without losing face in parliament over the budget political analysts said Officials working on the government's short-term economic package said it would probably include interest rate cuts on loans by government corporations deregulation measures to pass on some of the benefits of the strong yen to consumers in the form of lower prices and accelerated public investment They said a record portion of state investment planned for the entire 1987/88 fiscal year will take place in the first half probably over 80 pct Diplomats said that was unlikely to be enough to satisfy Reagan who is under pressure from the Democrat-controlled US Congress to take greater action to cut the huge American trade deficit To complement the short-term measures Nakasone is also likely to present Reagan with details of Japan's longer-term economic plans A high-ranking advisory body headed by former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa is expected to come up with a final report outlining concrete steps to redirect the economy days before Nakasone is scheduled to leave for Washington Its recommendations are designed as a follow-up to Maekawa's report last year on economic restructuring and are likely to cover such potentially politically explosive areas as agricultural reform and land policy officials said While wanting to make the report as explicit and detailed as possible they said the political realities might force them to water down some of the committee's recommendations A subcommittee is considering what the Japanese economy might look like in the medium to longer term after it undergoes massive restructuring officials said The subcommittee projects that the current account surplus will fall to less than two pct of Japan's total output or gross national product around 1993 or 1995 Last year the surplus which measures trade in goods and services amounted to over four pct of gnp The subcommittee also projects annual economic growth for Japan of nearly four pct over that period and a very gradual appreciation of the yen to about 130 to the dollar by around 1993 from 150 now finance ministry appears ready to allow Japanese financial institutions to use overseas financial futures markets a ministry official said He declined to say when but banking sources expect approval as early as April Banks securities houses and insurance companies are expected to become eligible to deal in deposit interest rate bond and stock index futures Ministry officials said they are wary of giving permission to individuals or corporations because of their relative inexperience Broking for Japanese residents by financial institutions would be prohibited as securities exchange laws bar banks from doing this the banking sources said Overseas subsidiaries and branches of Japanese banks and securities houses have already been allowed to use the overseas futures markets on their own accounts The Finance Ministry Ordinance based on Foreign Exchange Administration Law will have to be revised to allow local institutions to join the overseas markets a ministry official said 50-day provisional 1987/88 budget adopted today by the government allows the Finance Ministry to issue up to 14600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund financing bills government sources said Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used to buy dollars to prevent a further dollar fall The government sources said the amount covering the first 50 days of the year starting April 1 accounts for more than 90 pct of the 16000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full budget current account surplus rose to 738 billion dlrs in February from 389 billion a year ago and from 495 billion in January the Finance Ministry said The trade surplus rose to 814 billion dlrs in February from 477 billion a year earlier and 570 billion in January The long-term capital account deficit widened to 1140 billion dlrs from 806 billion a year ago but it narrowed from 1232 billion in January the Ministry said Japan's February exports rose to 1674 billion dlrs from 1489 billion in February 1986 and from 1465 billion in January the Ministry said Imports fell to 861 billion from 1012 billion a year earlier and 894 billion in January The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 402 billion dlrs from 417 billion in February 1986 and 737 billion in January Short-term capital account payments swung to a 128 billion dlr deficit in February from a 160 billion surplus a year earlier and a 144 billion dlr surplus in January Errors and omissions were 265 billion dlrs in surplus compared with a 127 billion surplus a year earlier and a 110 billion deficit in January The overall balance of payments deficit rose to 265 billion dlrs from 130 billion a year earlier but was down from 704 billion in January consumer price index (base 1985) was unchanged at 997 in February from a month earlier the government's Management and Coodination Agency said The index showed a 04 pct drop in January The February index was down one pct from a year earlier for the third consecutive year-on-year drop In January the index fell 11 pct from a year earlier the first drop of over one pct since a 13 pct drop in September 1958 Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has told his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to come up with a draft economic package in early April in time for his visit to Washington starting on April 29 government officials said Nakasone also instructed the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) to work closer with the LDP to work out a full-fledged economic plan to boost domestic demand as pledged at last month's Paris currency stability accord by six industrial countries the officials told Finance Ministry is expected to introduce yen commercial paper CP from October 1 in response to growing calls from corporations ministry sources said Around 200 corporations satisfy financial standards set by securities houses for non-collateral straight bond issues including electric power companies <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> and Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd securities managers said Most eligible firms would have to set up special reserves for CP issues called backup lines or be guaranteed by financial institutions to protect investors they said The legal status of yen CP would be the same as yen commercial bills and it would be placed by an intermediary bank or securities house securities managers said The minimum issue unit will be 100 mln yen and maturities will be from 30 days and six months they said Securities houses banks insurance companies and consumer credit companies are barred from CP issues they said Only banks may be commissioned to handle the clerical business of principle payments they added finance ministry appears ready to allow Japanese financial institutions to use overseas financial futures markets a ministry official said He declined to say when but banking sources expect approval as early as April Banks securities houses and insurance companies are expected to become eligible to deal in deposit interest rate bond and stock index futures Ministry officials said they are wary of giving permission to individuals or corporations because of their relative inexperience Broking for Japanese residents by financial institutions would be prohibited as securities exchange laws bar banks from doing this the banking sources said Overseas subsidiaries and branches of Japanese banks and securities houses have already been allowed to use the overseas futures markets on their own accounts The Finance Ministry Ordinance based on Foreign Exchange Administration Law will have to be revised to allow local institutions to join the overseas markets a ministry official said British government may revoke the licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London's financial City when they come up for renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up Japan's markets to foreign competition government sources said We can't say yes we are going to do it (revoke licences) but this is definitely being considered an official said His comments came after the government was formally urged today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint retaliatory action with the United States against Japan Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese trade practices There's a sense of urgency here now but the emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in Japan another government official told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access She clearly had Japan in mind government sources said The UK Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 37 billion stg official figures show A parliamentary motion signed by 98 MPs today urged the UK Government to coordinate action with the President of the United States and through the Department of Trade and Industry to suspend all further applications from Japanese communications companies for equipment approval by the British Approvals Board for Telecommunications and all further applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called restrictive conditions on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC) (cawlL) and its US And Japanese partners for a stake in Japan's international telecommunications market The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section of MPs reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on the Conservative government to take firm action Officials said another option now being considered by the UK Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese institutions That could be done under the government's proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament 58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal in London of which 29 are banks In Tokyo 14 London-based firms are authorised to do financial business officials said The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied under legally-binding international trade agreements The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in investment banking and insurance one official said This point has been made to the Japanese at official level a number times the official added Britain and France are now working together to urge that the European Community take collective action against Japan but by working within EC treaties another official said British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio interview that the European Community should build barriers against Japanese imports through certification procedures similar to those facing European exporters in Japan There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer he said adding (such barriers) can't be put in place overnight Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our own domestic market  It is really a question of fairness The situation is only likely to worsen following news that Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more than 70 pct in February year-on-year to 814 billion dlrs from 57 billion in January political sources said But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial institutions it would most likely focus on the smaller rather than larger ones to minimise any risks to its role as a global business centre government sources said Japan's four largest securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange In Washington White House officials said President Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors Limited Inc said it applied to list its common stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange The company said the review process will take four months and the company expects trading to begin in July Reagan was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States White House officials said There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the move could come today or early next week Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use semiconductors The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal computers television receivers and laser-printers with the aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms including NEC Corp Hitachi Ltd Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a week or two giving Japan a final opportunity to end the dumping practice but added that negotiators had already held extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail computer chip makers reacted angrily to news the United States plans to take retaliatory action against them for allegedly failing to live up to an agreement on trade in computer microchips Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) Chairman Shoichi Saba stated: EIAJ believes that it is premature and even irrational to attempt an assessment of the impact of the agreement and our efforts to comply with it only six months after concluding the agreement We urge US Governmental authorities to reconsider the decision made to evaluate fairly the results of Japanese efforts in implementing the objectives of the agreement and to resist emotional biases he said Yesterday Washington announced plans to slap as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation for what is sees as Japan's failure to comply with the terms of the pact The agreement struck late last year after months of heated negotiations called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips on world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors To salvage the pact Tokyo has instructed its chip makers to slash production and has helped establish a multi-lateral organisation designed to promote chip imports Saba said that Japanese chip companies have pledged three mln dlrs over the next five years to the new organisation and expressed regret that no American company has seen fit to join This suggests that American semiconductor manufacturers may not be really interested in participating in the Japanese market he said Korea signed with Japan for a 446 billion yen credit facility part of a four billion dlr aid package for South Korea's economic development plan to 1988 Foreign Ministry officials here said The facility to be used mostly for building a multi-purpose dam and modernising educational and medical facilities and for sewer projects bears interest of 425 pct per year and is repayable over 18 years after a grace period of seven years is in the process of joining the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) which will bring the number of members in the body to 36 ICCO officials said Japan is completing constitutional procedures necessary to its accession to the ICCO and is expected to become an importing member in three to four months they said Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect Tokyo is expected to propose a joint US/Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets Yesterday Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact That agreement hammered out late last year after months of heated negotiations called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made chips Nakasone's comments seemed distinctly more conciliatory than those of his Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura who earlier today said Japan was ready to take appropriate measures if Washington went ahead with the sanctions Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) officials later sought to downplay the significance of Tamura's remark and said that his main message was that the two sides need to talk urgently about the issue But they admitted that Japan was considering taking the United States to GATT the Geneva-based international organization which polices world trade if Washington imposed the tariffs Any Japanese action would probably be taken under Article 23 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) they said If that article were invoked GATT would set up a panel to consider the legality of the US Action But officials here said they hope that can be avoided It may be wishful thinking but there is a possibility the United States may lift its decision at an early date Tamura said In announcing the US Sanctions yesterday President Ronald Reagan said he was prepared to lift them once he had evidence that Japan was no longer dumping chips in world markets and had opened up its own market to imports Japanese government officials said they are confident they can make the pact work They said that the export of cut-price Japanese chips through unregulated distributors has all but dried up after MITI instructed domestic makers to cut output While acknowledging that it is harder to increase Japanese imports of American chips MITI officials said that the ministry is doing all it can to ensure that happens The Ministry recently called on Japan's major chip users some of whom are also leading producers to step up their purchases of foreign semiconductors A spokesman for one of the companies Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> said his firm would do just that and could announce its plans in the next week or so He expects other Japanese companies to do likewise is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the US From erupting into a full-scale trade war government officials said We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said On Friday Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact That agreement reached last year after heated negotiations called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success they said The perception of Japan in the (US) Congress is very bad one official told We would very much like to do something to respond to that In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas MITI officials sought to depict the US Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers not to the government Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute trade analysts said They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker NEC Corp was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact included enforced production cuts The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the US Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the US/Japan agreement said Shoichi Saba Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan He accused the US Of being irrational He said the US Action had made the bilateral chip pact meaningless Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the US Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17 Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of US Chips and to propose a joint investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping Bank of Japan has already purchased more than one billion dlrs in intervention since the opening and continues to buy the US Currency dealers said The central bank was supporting the dollar against the yen amid heavy selling pressure from investment trusts and securities houses which had pushed the dollar as low as 14475 yen earlier this morning they said The dollar recovered slightly from the intervention and was trading around 14500 they added It had opened in Tokyo at 14580 yen of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week he said He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the US Over semiconductors The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring he said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation with money supply growth accelerating he said Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall he said The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand he said United States and Japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors US Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television Baldrige referring to the US-Japan trade agreement on semiconductors said: Their government wants to live up to it Their industries haven't been doing it and I think we'll have a good settlement to spare both sides I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't lived up to this commitment he said He added: I do not think there will be a trade war at all On Friday Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17 because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as Japan started adhering to the agreement But they said there was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong US Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted He denied the action had been taken for that reason video tape recorder (VTR) production fell 104 pct from a year earlier to 218 mln sets in February for the third successive year-on-year drop reflecting slow exports the Electronic Industries Association of Japan said But February output was up 272 pct from a month earlier Colour television production rose 57 pct from a year earlier to 120 mln sets in February after 15 consecutive year-on-year drops The February increase over a year ago reflected higher domestic sales The production was up 385 pct from a month earlier dollar's tumble to a record low of 14470 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their US Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares dealers said The key US 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 9608-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 9805-06 New York finish then recovered to 9620-22 Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today accentuating the unit's tumble securities house dealers said They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said The dollar's plunge and low yields on US Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets securities bond managers said They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in US Bonds but many have lightened their US Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct Finance Ministry is trying to eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central banks in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets a senior Finance Ministry official said The official declined to give details but securities sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy bills The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is time consuming they said Securities houses here have had difficulty selling six-month debt-financing paper called tankoku to overseas governments and central banks because of the tax system and the Bank of Japan's book entry system which demands the accounts be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank Tankoku introduced in February 1986 were designed as a key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of the yen But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry system for bill purchases in January 1986 foreign governments and central banks have shied away from buying the bills the sources said Foreign governments and central banks are therefore expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of Japan the securities sources said Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next US-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of Tokyo's financial market expected in May they said Metal Mining Co said it will raise its monthly nickel output to around 1750 tonnes from April 1 from 1650 now because of increased domestic demand mainly from stainless steel makers Sumitomo produced 1800 tonnes of a nickel a month until end-1986 but cut output in January because of stagnant demand a company official said Calendar 1987 production is likely to fall to around 20000 tonnes from 22000 in 1986 as a result of the first quarter reduction he said Sumitomo is Japan's only nickel producer vehicle exports fell 82 pct in February from January to 530066 the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said February exports fell 68 pct from a year earlier after a 68 pct year-on-year rise in January the first growth since June 1986 when they rose 44 pct from a year earlier February exports included 361285 cars down 63 pct from a year earlier 165770 trucks down 86 pct and 3011 buses up 514 pct Exports to the US Fell to 226942 in February from 259272 a year earlier while those to the European Community rose to 141095 from 121050 The EC figure included 63387 vehicles to West Germany up from 41821 but exports to Britain fell to 20554 from 28536 Shipments to South-east Asia fell to 33957 from 41960 and those to the Middle East fell to 15828 from 25278 Japan's motorcycle exports rose 18 pct from January to 177115 in February but fell 259 pct from a year earlier the 12th consecutive year-on-year drop Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures including market intervention to support the dollar above that level Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations He did not elaborate Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market plunged sharply just before the close of trade as the yen's continued rise against the dollar and Friday's order by President Reagan to impose weighty duties on key Japanese export sectors prompted investors to evacuate their stock holdings brokers said At 1456 local time the index had slumped 50298 to 2167504 the day's low On Saturday the index rose 15136 to a record high of 2217802 Brokers said today's decline was led by selling of multinational export companies' shares is becoming dangerously isolated again as the US And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth officials and businessmen from around the world said As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April last year The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses Japan must make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week The US Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the US On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture On Friday European currency dealers said European central banks annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen Eishiro Saito head of top Japanese business group Keidanren spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report he said We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demandWould take time Saito said Saito's words were ignored In February EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said I only know that your government under the leadership of Maekawa points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking more inward looking one It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe And Europeans and Americans want quick action A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy the kind suggested by the Maekawa report And we hope to see changes occur in the near future visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March Such expectations are now ingrained which was partly the fault of Nakasone who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs said US Officials Months before the report was issued US And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour said Philip Caldwell Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report including restructuring of the coal and steel industries A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy Europeans are confused about this underlined by von Moltke's reference to the leadership of the Maekawa report Even so Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures Without endorsing the report as policy officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report the ambassador said Finance Ministry said it proposed to the underwriting syndicate a record low 47 pct coupon on the 10-year government bond to be issued in April down from the previous record low five pct March issue The bond would be priced at 9975 to yield 4736 pct compared with 9950 and 5075 pct in March and proposed issue volume is 1400 billion yen against 475 billion it said The syndicate is expected to accept the terms immediately underwriters said Japanese government appears to have little new to offer to settle a dispute with the US Over computer chips trade analysts and government officials said The US Has threatened to impose tariffs worth up to 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronics exports to the US In retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to keep a pact on the microchip trade signed last September A Foreign Ministry official told Japan has done what it can and now we must persuade the United States to wait for those steps to take effect The US Alleges that in defiance of the September agreement Japan is still selling microchips at below cost in non-US Markets and refusing to open Japan further to US Chip sales US Tariffs are due to take effect on April 17 Analysts noted Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has already ordered chipmakers to cut production in order to dry up the source of cheap chips sold in third countries at non-regulated prices I'm not sure MITI can do much more than it has said Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards A MITI official said the Ministry was not planning to call for production cuts beyond those already sought although it would continue to press chip users to buy more foreign goods Spokesmen for some Japanese electronics firms said they would consider buying more US Chips But a Matsushita Electric Industrial Co spokesman said a rapid increase in imports was not likely Most analysts said Japanese exporters would be hard hit if the United States did implement the tariffs which would be levied on consumer electronics products rather than on microchips themselves If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time there will be complete erosion of exports to the United States said Tom Murtha analyst at James Capel and Co The Japanese electronics industry is too powerful to be stopped altogether but recovery for the industry will be delayed for another year he said Some analysts said tariffs would also harm US Industry by stepping up offshore production and by reducing demand in Japan for semiconductors US Firms are trying to sell here The American approach is full of contradictions Jardine Fleming's Edwards said If they want to expand (US) exports the last thing they want to do is hit the makers of the final products because that hurts the final market Edwards said But other analysts said the dispute reflects not just US Concern over what it sees as a strategic industry but also frustration with Japan's vast trade surplus Some analysts argued that to solve the semiconductor problem Japan may have to take action beyond that pledged in the semiconductor pact Carole Ryavec an analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd said The major overall issue is to stimulate the domestic economy and move away from an export-dependent economy by Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading dealers said After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 14640/50 yen from an initial low of 14420/40 and New York's Friday finish of 14715/25 But the rebound was largely on short-covering they said I think (Nakasone's) desperate said a US Bank foreign exchange manager Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen said PS Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets and is likely to rebound But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the US And Japan will continue to depress the dollar The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country's 1698 billion dlr trade deficit they said securities houses and banks are eager to enter the market for lead-management of mark eurobonds when the ban on Japanese institutions is lifted but the entry may be difficult Japanese bankers said Most Japanese securities houses and banks established here said they have concrete plans to enter lead-management business as soon as terms are cleared probably this year Japan's largest bank The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd is also considering expanding its business here bankers said Japanese banks were excluded from lead management of mark eurobonds when the Bundesbank opened that market to foreign banks in May 1985 due to the lack of reciprocity for German banks in the Japanese market Last year the Japanese began a slow opening by granting West German banks investment licences Pressure on Tokyo stepped up last week when UK Government sources said Britain may revoke the licences of some Japanese banks and securities firms operating in London when they come up for renewal if progress is not made towards opening Japan's markets to foreign competition A spokesman for the Dai-Ichi Kangyo representative office here said the bank was naturally considering options such as expanding its mark securities trading operations to Frankfurt Sources at the bank's London branch said the bank was already seriously planning such a move Expanding secondary operations would also improve the placement capacity of Japanese houses intending to move into lead management of mark eurobonds But even Japanese banks already established in secondary markets here face a host of problems in lead management One is finding borrowers One banker at Nikko Securities Co Ltd's The Nikko Securities Co (Deutschland) GmbH said the cost of mark issues may be too high for some Japanese firms For the moment for Japanese borrowers marks are expensive he said Many prefer Swiss francs or eurodollars A Japanese borrower with a five-year equity warrant eurodollar bond issued at 2-1/2 pct can now swap into domestic yen rates of one pct But mark swap opportunities are limited In addition many Japanese companies are committed already to large German banks To avoid souring relations with German banks they now cooperate with Japanese houses may prefer finding borrowers so far not seen in the mark sector Names may include Sanyo Electric Co Ltd and Nishimatsu Construction Co Ltd which both count Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd as their house bank or Hokkaido Electric Power Co Inc which recently gave a presentation here with the Industrial Bank of Japan's unit here Japanese banks are also faced with finding local personnel which is not easy They are definitely going to have a manpower problem one Swiss banker said Swiss and American banks had no trouble attracting top German managers But Japanese cultural differences will be harder for Germans to overcome Success may depend on whether Japanese parents allow German subsidiaries independence to operate without interference Once established more problems are expected if extra competition shaves margins Extra competition could cut management fees in the mark sector Separate management and underwriting fees common here may also be eroded which now make German underwriting business profitable compared with other centres A few banks are unsure if they really want to get involved in the business I don't think Sumitomo has 100-pct concrete plans at this moment unless there is a new development a banker at the West German commercial branch of Sumito Bank Ltd in Duesseldorf said Apart from the commercial branch in Duesseldorf Sumitomo has a rep office in Frankfurt but both are primarily engaged in commercial banking If Sumitomo were to set up a securities operation it would have to set up a full subsidiary he said Tokyo Stock Exchange said it cut trading time from today by 30 minutes to inhibit volume after recent trade turnover records The cut extends the lunch break to 1115 to 1330 local time (0315 to 0530 GMT) from 1115 to 1300 local time (0315 to 0500 GMT) and follows record turnover of 26 billion shares on Friday feed and starch makers actively bought US Corn last week C and F basis for July/September shipment in view of bullish freight rates following active inquiries by the Soviet Union trade sources said Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April one source said The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400000 to 500000 tonnes from an anticipated 800000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700000 to 800000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability crushers have bought some 214000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for late April/early July shipment and may buy up to 140000 to 190000 tonnes more for June to August shipment trade sources said Japan imported 128089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986 Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than US Origin which may account for the heavy purchases but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there The Japanese purchases comprise 30000 tonnes for April 20/May 10 shipment 102000 for May 15000 for late May/early June 36000 for June and 31000 for late June/early July shipment the sources said As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans purchased Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150000 tonnes of US Beans for May shipment Some 100000 of this shipment has already been purchased the sources added They said crushers bought some 270000 to 280000 tonnes of US Beans for April shipment Bank of Japan will sell 500 billion yen of financing bills via a 32-day repurchase agreement to help mop up a money market surplus of around 1750 billion yen tomorrow short-term money houses said The bill to mature on May 2 will produce a 38995 pct yield on the sales made by the Bank of Japan to banks and seucurities houses through money houses they said The repurchase agreement yield compares with the 39375 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 440 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit The surplus is due largely to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities at the end of fiscal 1986/87 tomorrow The operation will put outstanding bill supplies at about 2500 billion yen ailing shipyards have won approval from the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash production to about half of total capacity for one year effective April 1 industry sources said The approval follows an act of parliament passed last week designed to help the industry regroup and shed 20 pct of capacity by March 31 1988 Transport Ministry officials said The cartel comprising 33 yards capable of constructing ships of more than 10000 gross tonnes will limit newbuilding output to a maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes in 1987/88 the Shipbuilders Association of Japan said Industry sources said the 33 will seek to renew the cartel in 1988/89 in the belief demand will remain sluggish Last week's temporary act of parliament also allows shipbuilders to receive favourable taxation terms plus up to 50 billion yen in compensation for liabilities incurred through job losses and the sale of excess capacity Up to 30 billion yen has been allocated for purchasing redundant land and equipment from shipbuilders The Ministry will start drawing up its restructuring guidelines from April 1 and the yards will implement the guidelines from September industry sources said Industries Inc <TORTT> Japan's top synthetic fibre maker named managing director Katsunosuke Maeda as president effective April 16 Current president Yoshikazu Ito will become chairman Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expects the dollar to rebound soon a Ministry spokesman said He quoted Miyazawa as telling Japanese reporters that major industrial nations are aggressively intervening in currency markets worldwide to prevent a dollar free-fall The minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 14470 yen today according to the spokesman Miyazawa told the Japanese reporters the US Unit fell because Japanese investors sold dollars to hedge currency risks before the close of the 1986/87 fiscal year on March 31 Mexicana SA de CV> owned 964 pct by Nissan Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> and the rest by Marubeni Corp <MARTT> will supply all engines for manual transmission Sentra cars produced by Nissan Motor's wholly-owned subsidiary <Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp USA> (NMMC) a Nissan spokeswoman said Nissan's shift to Mexican production from Japan is due to improved quality there and the yen's rise against the dollar From July 1987 all car engines for NMMC will be supplied by Nissan Mexicana As a start Nissan Mexicana shipped a total of 17000 car engines to NMMC last summer the spokeswoman said NMMC in Smyrna Tennessee which has produced Sentras since March 1985 made 65000 cars NMMC will more than double Sentra production to 140000 this year including 80000 to 90000 manuals she said Finance Ministry official said the ministry has recently conducted a survey on foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors but declined to say if it was aimed at moderating their dollar sales However financial market sources said they had heard the ministry has asked life insurance and securities firms to refrain from selling dollars but they were unable to confirm this directly Dealers said life insurance firms were not major sellers of dollars in recent trading sessions because they had already sold them to hedge risks Dealers said securities houses and trust banks on the other hand have aggressively sold the dollar Finance Ministry is trying to eliminate technical obstacles so as to encourage purchases of Japanese Treasury bills by foreign governments and central banks in order to increase overseas holdings of yen assets a senior Finance Ministry official said The official declined to give details but securities sources said they expect the 16 pct withholding tax on T-bills to be repaid immediately when governments and central banks buy bills The current practice of filing tax redemption claims is time consuming they said Securities houses here have had difficulty selling six-month debt-financing paper called tankoku to overseas governments and central banks because of the tax system and the Bank of Japan's book entry system which demands the accounts be kept with the houses rather than by the Bank Tankoku introduced in February 1986 were designed as a key short-term instrument to promote internationalization of the yen But since the introduction of a complicated book-entry system for bill purchases in January 1986 foreign governments and central banks have shied away from buying the bills the sources said Foreign governments and central banks are therefore expected to be allowed to hold their accounts at the Bank of Japan the securities sources said Relevant measures are likely to be announced at the next US-Japan yen-dollar committee meeting on the deregulation of Tokyo's financial market expected in May they said Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures including market intervention to support the dollar above that level Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations He did not elaborate Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa expects the dollar to rebound soon a Ministry spokesman said He quoted Miyazawa as telling Japanese reporters that major industrial nations are aggressively intervening in currency markets worldwide to prevent a dollar free-fall The minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 14470 yen today according to the spokesman Miyazawa told the Japanese reporters the US Unit fell because Japanese investors sold dollars to hedge currency risks before the close of the 1986/87 fiscal year on March 31 Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone sounded a conciliatory note in Japan's increasingly bitter row with the United States over trade in computer microchips Japan wants to resolve the issue through consultations by explaining its stance thoroughly and correcting the points that need to be corrected he was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying While expressing regret over America's decision to impose tariffs on imports of Japanese electrical goods Nakasone said Tokyo was willing to send a high-level official to Washington to help settle the dispute Government officials said Japan would make a formal request next week for emergency talks and that the two sides would probably meet the week after just days before the April 17 deadline set by Washington for the tariffs to take effect Tokyo is expected to propose a joint US/Japan investigation of American claims that Japanese companies are dumping cut-price chips in Asian markets On Friday Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on imports of certain Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to live up to their bilateral chip pact of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week he said He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the US over semiconductors The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring he said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax is becoming dangerously isolated again as the US And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth officials and businessmen from around the world said As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April last year The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses Japan must make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week The US Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the US On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture On Friday European currency dealers said European central banks annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen Eishiro Saito head of top Japanese business group Keidanren spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report he said We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demandWould take time Saito said Saito's words were ignored In February EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said I only know that your government under the leadership of Maekawa points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking more inward looking one It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe And Europeans and Americans want quick action A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy the kind suggested by the Maekawa report And we hope to see changes occur in the near future visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March Such expectations are now ingrained which was partly the fault of Nakasone who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs said US Officials Months before the report was issued US And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour said Philip Caldwell Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report including restructuring of the coal and steel industries A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy Europeans are confused about this underlined by von Moltke's reference to the leadership of the Maekawa report Even so Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures Without endorsing the report as policy officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report the ambassador said of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank will carefully consider its monetary policy in light of the recent sharp fall of the dollar Asked if the Bank of Japan will consider a further cut in its discount rate he said he now thinks the bank will have to carefully consider its future money policy He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that credit conditions have been eased by the five discount rate cuts by Japan since the beginning of last year Japan must now be especially careful about a flare-up in inflation with money supply growth accelerating he said Sumita said the central bank would continue to make a judgement on monetary policies while watching consumer prices exchange rates and economic and financial conditions both in and outside Japan Asked if the September 1985 Plaza agreement was a failure because the dollar had fallen too far Sumita said he still thought the pact was a good one in the sense that it had corrected the overvaluation of the dollar But the Plaza accord did not set any target for the dollar's fall he said The dollar's steep fall stems from the market's belief that the trade imbalance will continue to expand he said is seeking to prevent its computer chips dispute with the US From erupting into a full-scale trade war government officials said We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United States a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) official said On Friday Washington announced plans for as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact That agreement reached last year after heated negotiations called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the end of April While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure the chip pact is working the government is studying measures it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure the trip's success they said The perception of Japan in the (US) Congress is very bad one official told We would very much like to do something to respond to that In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from spreading to other areas MITI officials sought to depict the US Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor makers not to the government Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an angry American Congress the Japanese government has been forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor dispute trade analysts said They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest chip maker NEC Corp was not happy with what it viewed as the draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact included enforced production cuts The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the announcement of the US Tariffs highlighted the difficulties the government faces in taking further action Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the US/Japan agreement said Shoichi Saba Chairman of the Electronic Industries Association of Japan He accused the US of being irrational He said the US action had made the bilateral chip pact meaningless Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute through consultations Japan is expected to send a high-level official to Washington early next month to try to convince the US Not to go ahead with the tariffs on April 17 Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry plans to step up purchases of US chips and to propose a joint investigation into US allegations of chip dumping a bid to hasten Japan's promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade top US officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides Assistant Secretary David Mulford said last week there was no target for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention That was no slip of the tongue said one western monetary official who asked not to be identified For now the strategy appears to be working Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April Until last week there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon The Reagan administration facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 1698 billion dlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results from Japan dramatic action is required Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries The shift in US strategy in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of US officials Nonetheless US officials see signs of improvement in the deficit I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits (from the lower dollar) soon said one In Paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit The three nations joined by France Britain and Canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one Markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures -- including US budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out Nonetheless the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation A US economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although Japan is an obvious exception Everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments But last week the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and other central banks about one billion dlrs Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting the Paris accord outright The source close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking said Japan's understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar the level it stood at when the accord was struck The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies It was a pointed reminder to Japan to do something about the trade issues the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar Later in the week Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth But US officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances ought to be adjusted one official said While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation another US official said The officials said the meeting here where the six will be joined by Italy will be a status report Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans Maybe there's a need to move faster one source said Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called in effect for currency stability for several months This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the US trade deficit His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the US trade deficit United States and Japan will soon settle their trade dispute over semiconductors US Commerce secretary Malcolm Baldrige said on television Baldrige referring to the US-Japan trade agreement on semiconductors said: Their government wants to live up to it Their industries haven't been doing it and I think we'll have a good settlement to spare both sides I think the Japanese understand full well that they haven't lived up to this commitment he said He added: I do not think there will be a trade war at all On Friday Washington announced plans to put as much as 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods from April 17 because of Tokyo's failure to observe the agreement The officials said the tariffs would be ended as soon as Japan started adhering to the agreement But they said there was little chance Japan could react quickly enough to avert the higher tariffs Baldrige said the Reagan administration hoped the strong US Action against Japan would convince Congress to tone down protectionist trade legislation now being drafted He denied the action had been taken for that reason government is determined to ride out the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove temporary senior officials said The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit one senior Finance Ministry official said He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special factors in particular selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here the senior official said They (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock (0100 GMT) he said After falling to a record low of 14470 yen this morning the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 14620 Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall One official even called the market's recent actions irrational If anything the US Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the US He said As a result several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month's meeting of major nations in Paris We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy stance one senior official said by Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading dealers said After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 14640/50 yen from an initial low of 14420/40 and New York's Friday finish of 14715/25 But the rebound was largely on short-covering they said I think (Nakasone's) desperate said a US Bank foreign exchange manager Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen said PS Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets and is likely to rebound But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the US And Japan will continue to depress the dollar The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country's 1698 billion dlr trade deficit they said Finance Ministry official said the ministry has recently conducted a survey on foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors but declined to say if it was aimed at moderating their dollar sales However financial market sources said they had heard the ministry has asked life insurance and securities firms to refrain from selling dollars but they were unable to confirm this directly Dealers said life insurance firms were not major sellers of dollars in recent trading sessions because they had already sold them to hedge risks Dealers said securities houses and trust banks on the other hand have aggressively sold the dollar dollar's tumble to a record low of 14470 yen in Tokyo today motivated some major Japanese investors to lighten their US Bond inventory further and is expected to spur diversification into investment assets including foreign and domestic shares dealers said The key US 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond due 2016 fell to a low of 9608-12 in early Tokyo trade against the 9805-06 New York finish then recovered to 9620-22 Some trust bank pension fund acccounts and investment trusts were seen selling several hundred million dollars on the foreign exchange market here today accentuating the unit's tumble securities house dealers said They seem undecided on what to do with the fresh yen cash positions resulting from their dollar sales today and are sidelined until the currency market stabilises and the interest rates outlook clarifies a Nikko Securities Co Ltd currency trader said The dollar's plunge and low yields on US Bonds will further promote diversification into other foreign investments as well as call back funds into the domestic bond and stock markets from overseas bond markets securities bond managers said They said major Japanese investors in the past two years are estimated to have held 50 to 80 pct of their foreign portfolios in US Bonds but many have lightened their US Bond inventory to as low as 40 pct Since late last year Japanese investors seeking substantial liquidity and attractive yields have used fresh funds to buy mark and Canadian dollar bonds and after the Paris currency pact actively bought French franc bonds and gilts while gradually lightening US Bond inventories the managers said Dealers said funds tied up in foreign assets had flowed into local bond and stock markets as well The yield of the key 51 pct 89th bond dropped to a record low of 4080 pct today from the 4140 Saturday finish and compared with 425 pct on three-month certificates of deposit The key bond has fluctuated less than five basis points for more than a month here suggesting most dealers could not satisfy their needs for capital gains dealers said A market survey by showed some active accounts in US Treasuries are currently dealing on Tokyo's stock market The stock market's bullishness late last week was partly due to funds transferred from US Treasuries dealers said Japanese net purchases of foreign securities in the first half of March fell an estimated one billion dlrs compared with average monthly net purchases of 77 billion for the whole of 1986 Finance Ministry sources said The steep fall is due to Japanese investors' cool attitude towards US Bonds which had amounted to more than 80 pct of total foreign securities purchased securities houses managers said Foreign stock buying in March is expected to exceed the record high of 15 billion dlrs seen in December they said Diversification of foreign portfolios is underway and we have bought bonds in currencies such as marks the Canadian dollar the ECU and French franc a fund manager at <Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd> said US Congress is making Japan with its enormous worldwide trade surplus the symbol of the US trade crisis and the focus of its efforts to turn around America's record trade deficit Japan has come to symbolize what we fear most in trade: the challenge to our high technology industries the threat of government nutured competition and the multitude of barriers to our exports Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd said If we can find a way to come to terms with Japan over trade problems we can manage our difficulties with other countries the West Virginia Democrat said at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the trade bill Byrd and House Speaker Jim Wright a Texas Democrat have made trade legislation a priority this year and a wide-ranging bill is being readied for probable House approval next month Japan's bilateral trade surplus jumped from 12 billion dlrs in 1980 to 62 billion dlrs last year Its surplus rose to 814 billion dlrs in February from 57 billion dlrs in January Congress points to the record 169 billion dlrs US trade deficit in 1986 and the slow response in the trade imbalance to the dollar's decline in world currency markets as a reason to press Japan to buy more US goods They are particularly dismayed by the rapid deterioration in US exports of sophisticated computer technology In response to the growing anger and pressure by the US semiconductor industry President Reagan Friday announced he intended to raise tariffs as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods in retaliation for Japan's failure to abide by a 1986 US-Japanese semiconductor agreement Congress also has been been angered by the administration's lack of success with Japan on a host of other trade issues including beef citrus automobile parts telecommunications goods and financial services The bulk of the House trade bill was written last week in four committees It is a package of trade sanctions and measures to force the administration take tough action against foreign trade barriers and unfair competition Although most provisions do not single out Japan in many cases their impact would be to restrict imports of Japanese products or make them more expensive with higher duties The cornerstone of the trade legislation passed the House Ways and Means Committee by a vote of 34 to 2 Its focus is to force President Reagan to retaliate against unfair foreign competition and to make it easier for US industries to win temporary relief from surges in imports The most controversial issue an amendment to restrict imports if countries such as Japan with large surpluses do not buy more US goods was left for an April vote by the House Rep Richard Gephardt a Democratic presidential aspirant from Missouri has the support of Wright and other key Democrats to press for passage of the amendment The measure would have the most impact on Japan West Germany Taiwan and South Korea If Japan for example does not reduce its barriers by mid-1988 the United States would set import quotas or tariffs to cut Japanese surplus by ten per cent a year for three years I'm tired of going into companies and having managers say to me 'We're not over competing in Japan because we can't compete in the marketplace' That argument needs to be taken away from American business Gephardt said The administration has said it could not support a trade bill containing such a provision Corp <SNET> will increase production abroad to overcome falling profits caused by the yen's rise against the dollar managing board chairman Akio Morita told the West German newspaper Die Welt He was quoted as saying that Sony whose latest profit figures had been affected strongly by dollar fluctuations would increase production in the US And Europe Several production facilities were being built he added At the same time we are also investing capital in order to modernise our locations and raise our productivity Morita said that to overcome the same currency problems Japan needs to restructure its economy in order to live less from exports and more from domestic demand He said US And European companies had made the mistake of not investing enough in the future which was why they had lost their lead in consumer electronics They may spend a lot of money on research and development he said But planning and marketing are very important sectors in developing a marketable product If they don't spend money on these they can't build up new business lines Speaking of difficulties foreign firms experience in penetrating the Japanese market Morita said Naturally I have to admit that there are still many obstacles in Japan On the other hand many foreign firms were too interested in short-term success he said If therefore a company comes to Japan and wants to make a profit at once on this market it is not so simple These people then complain while the successful firms keep their mouths shut Morita said crushers bought 2000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for May shipment trade sources said high level US trade official said it would be foolish for Japan to strike back against the United States for its sanctions on Japanese semiconductor electronics products Asked by reporters if Japan was expected to retaliate against US exports Deputy Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart replied That would be the height of foolishness In addition he doubted Japan could show enough progress in meeting the conditions of the agreement to avoid the actual imposition of the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on April 17 Japan's 586 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs US trade deficit in 1986 President Reagan's sanctions decision won praise today from the two Democratic leaders of Congress I think it's about time Senate Democratic Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia told reporters House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas told reporters before the opening of the House session It just shows we were right all along when we said something needs doing Smart testified before a Senate Labor Committee hearing that last Friday's US trade action would help US negotiations on access to Japan for US auto parts Since last August Smart has been leading talks to open up Japan to purchases of more US-made automotive parts Last year Japan racked up a 36 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States in these products Both countries expect to conclude the talks by August 1987 It's amazing to me that the Japanese were surprised I hope it will persuade them we're serious Smart said of the White House trade sanctions The United States has tried to convince Japanese car companies of the quality of American-made parts and to draw them away from their traditional Japanese suppliers All we ask is a chance We have a job to do persuading them we can do better than our reputation seems to be he said Measured per car each American-made car contained about 700 dlrs in Japanese auto parts while each Japanese-made car contained about 26 dlrs in US auto parts Smart said seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 29 pct in February from the record 30 pct in January the government's Management and Coordination Agency said The January level was the worst since the Goverment started compiling unemployment statistics under the current system in 1953 Unemployment was up from 28 pct a year earlier Unadjusted February unemployment totalled 186 mln people up from 182 mln in January and 164 mln a year earlier Male unemployment in February remained at 29 pct equal to the second-highest level set in January and December Record male unemployment of 31 pct was set in July 1986 Female unemployment rose to a record 31 pct in February from the previous record 30 pct marked in January 1987 and in April August September and December last year Japan's employment condition was still severe in February as the non-rounded rate of unemployment in February fell only 003 percentage points to 293 pct from 296 pct in January an agency official said Employment in manufacturing industries fell 430000 from a year earlier to 1422 mln people in February due to the yen's continued appreciation while employment in non-manufacturing industries rose 380000 to 1211 mln In manufacturing industries employment in the textile industry fell 180000 to 194 mln in February while in ordinary and precision machinery industries it fell 160000 to 150 mln Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he regards a US Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement struck by major nations in Paris last month He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150 yen as it considered the dollar's fall below that level counter to the spirit of the Paris accord Commenting on current foreign exchange movements Miyazawa said Japan would watch developments for another couple of days Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year today Miyazawa said Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception that major nations were not doing enough to implement their policies under the Paris pact he said noting that passage of Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed He said that now was the time for major nations to act under the Paris accord The US West Germany France Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to prop up the dollar he said This was a concerted action US Is willing to drop tariffs on Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an agreement opening its markets to American goods US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview But there has to be a clear indication that they are willing to act he said Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the US Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are problems they have brought on themselves The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan he said My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction Although I can sympathise it's occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan The tariffs announced on Friday by President Reagan will affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products only a tiny fraction of Japan's total exports to the US Even so Reagan's decision doesn't give us any joy We don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to Yeutter said Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include some difficult items on the agenda Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement Yeutter said Japan has stopped dumping chips in the US But it has failed to open its domestic markets to US-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries undercutting US Products he said has decided to cooperate with the US To develop a new generation of fighter planes Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara said Japan is now in a major trade dispute with Washington but Kurihara told reporters the decision was not made in response to outside pressure and described the project as a Japanese-led program with US Cooperation President Ronald Reagan said last week that the US Would impose high tariffs on Japanese imports to retaliate against alleged Japanese violation of a computer chip trade pact The plane codenamed the FSX has been the focus of competition between Japanese and US Defence contractors At stake is an estimated 65 billion dlrs worth of contracts which the Japanese government had previously intended to award to domestic firms The Ministry has said the plane part of Japan's self defence forces will be equipped with high technology radar dodging equipment and will be able to fly at very low altitudes It will have a combat radius of 830 kms The ministry plans to build 100 FSX fighters to replace all 77 of Japan's Mitsubishi-made F-1 planes by the 1990s A defence ministry spokesman said the timing of the announcement had nothing to do with escalating trade friction between Japan and the US Its largest trading partner This is an objective decision made after discussions with US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger he said However with two weeks to go before the US Imposes tariffs Japan's ambassador to the US Nobuo Matsunaga told Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari that Japan must address individual market-opening issues such as the FSX defence ministry officials said housing starts in February rose 134 pct from a year earlier to 109254 the 10th successive year-on-year gain the Construction Ministry said February housing starts were up 168 pct from 93554 in January when they fell 274 pct from a month earlier but rose 103 pct from a year earlier Higher housing starts were mainly due to a 268 pct year-on-year rise in apartment building starts to 51829 for the 56th consecutive gain spurred primarily by lower domestic interest rates RUTER Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone may have been dealt a fatal political blow by the yen's renewed rapid rise and the threat of a trade war with the United States political analysts said Nakasone already under fire over an unpopular tax reform plan may now be forced to resign before the June economic summit of seven industrialised nations if local elections later next month go against candidates from his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) they said The close relationship between Nakasone and President Reagan was an important element of Nakasone's power base Waseda University Political Science Professor Mitsuru Uchida told So the emergence of US Criticism damages Nakasone Even before the latest trade friction flared Nakasone was encountering criticism not only from opposition parties but also within his own LDP over his proposal to levy a sales tax Many factions within the LDP are distancing themselves from Nakasone Uchida said His position within the LDP itself is not so strongly established today Nakasone who has been more popular with the general public than with many LDP members is now seeing his public support eroded the analysts said The yen's rise to record highs and the US Threat on Friday to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a microchip trade pact are now giving Nakasone's critics fresh ammunition the analysts said Apparently the special relationship between Reagan and Nakasone hasn't worked effectively Rei Shiratori director of the Institute for Political Studies in Japan said This is making the Japanese people doubt Nakasone's credibility Shiratori told The cumulative impact of the sales tax issue the yen's rise and mounting trade friction could mean serious LDP losses in the April 11 and 26 local elections analysts said If the elections go against the LDP Nakasone may have to resign early Shiratori said But Nakasone still has a chance to soothe US Tempers before or during his week-long Washington visit from April 29 some analysts said However unless the Japanese political system can move more quickly to give Nakasone some nice present to take to Washington on smouldering trade issues he will face a very hostile audience said Merrill Lynch Securities economist William Sterling If the trip is a major disaster it would seem to put the final nail in his coffin he said Reagan's own weakened domestic position and growing Republican as well as Democratic anger with Japan argue against a quick settlement to the trade dispute the analysts said But a desire on both sides to find some solution coupled with uncertainty at home and abroad over likely successors to Nakasone could still lead to an attempt to paper over the differences and aid Nakasone they said One factor against a trade war may be that Washington is not anxious to push Nakasone into his grave Sterling said Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Japan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measures immediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget He told a Lower House budget committee the government is likely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and a new policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by government agencies and ministries for 1988/89 The government had cut budgetary requests in the past five years in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy of stopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990 The passage of the budget is expected in late May Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same session Japan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meet domestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government to stop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time Nakasone said he had instructed his Liberal Democratic Party to prepare its own economic package in time for his one-week visit to Washington starting on April 29 will pay five pct less for the Indian iron ore it imports in fiscal 1987/88 starting April 1 than the average 18 dlrs a tonne it paid in 1986/87 a government trade official told He said India had agreed to export to Japan about 23 mln tonnes of iron ore in 1987/88 about the same as in the current year The official described the agreement as satisfactory overall He said it was signed by an official Indian trade delegation and Japanese businessmen in Tokyo last week The official said it was encouraging that Japan had agreed not to reduce ore imports from India although Japan's total iron ore imports would be lower in the coming year because of the recession in the Japanese steel industry He said Japanese ore imports in calendar 1987 would total 96 mln tonnes compared with 1035 mln in 1986 Government officials said India's total ore exports are likely to rise to between 33 and 34 mln tonnes in 1987/88 against a provisionally estimated 31 mln in 1986/87 Photo Film Co Ltd will set up a wholly-owned subsidiary in Kleve West Germany to produce video cassette tapes a spokesman said The company <Fuji Magnetics GmbH> will be capitalised at 25 mln marks and produce two mln tapes a month for the European market from early 1988 he said Total investment will be about 100 mln marks and the plant will create 200 jobs including about 190 for local workers Fuji Photo plans to make the Kleve plant its European production centre for magnetic products and may make audio cassette tapes and floppy discs later the spokesman said investors are reluctant to buy West German stocks now considered one of the most attractive buys around after having taken a beating for the past two years investment managers said Although the Frankfurt stock market is one of the world's largest in capitalisation wealthy Japanese institutions view it as too small They also worry about venturing into a market from which British investors have recently bailed out they said There's not enough turnover there to absorb the amount of buying Japanese want to do one West German investment manager said There is a danger Japanese institutions may be unable to liquidate their holdings quickly if the market takes a sudden downturn he added Japanese familiarity with West German stocks is also limited another investment manager said They know the blue chips but there are too many other names they don't know The recent rapid advance of the Tokyo stock market has also deterred Japanese from wandering off to markets abroad investment managers said Japanese fund managers are afraid of criticism if they buy into unsure overseas markets while the market at home continues to advance said Seiji Yamamoto senior manager at Dresdner ABD Securities Ltd's Tokyo branch If gains from investments abroad lag behind those possible from the Tokyo market they could face difficulty explaining their funds' performance he added The Frankfurt market's 15 pct depreciation just since the beginning of this year has also been causing Japanese investors to turn away one investment manager said The Frankfurt slump stems from expectations of slow corporate growth due to the mark's strength against the dollar and a withdrawal of funds by British institutions just before the London market's liberalisation last year the investment manager said Right now Japanese investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude while the condition of the market remains unfavourable he said Although there has been some nibbling of West German stocks particularly last week most of the buys were for short-term trades rather than long-term investments an investment advisor at a West German firm said Investment managers believe however that genuine interest in West German stocks could develop within the next three to six months Japanese fund managers still favour the New York and the London markets over the Frankfurt market but they are interested in diversifying some of their funds they said Some managers have been travelling in Europe looking for new opportunities and are unlikely to ignore West German stocks especially with the average price/earnings ratio at about 11 they said The Frankfurt ratio compares with about 16 for the US And London markets and 52 for the Japanese market Guenter Kirchhain first vice president for Deutsche Bank AG said This mismatching will sooner or later generate an enormous alignment potential he said The West German market could reasonably have an average price/earnings ratio of around 16 he added Japanese investment plans may soon become clearer as many institutions begin their new business years in April he said However one fund manager does not agree that new investment in West Germany will come that soon Japanese do not buy into a market with declining fundamentals he said When West Germany's fundamental economic indicators appear to have bottomed out that will be the turning point for their investments he added Another manager said the Japanese are waiting to see the investment trends set by US And British investors in the West German market They are waiting for someone to make the first move he said Ltd <HITT> expects to achieve its parent company sales estimate of 2900 billion yen in the year ending March 31 helped by high general-use ultra-large computer sales and despite the higher-than-expected yen Current profits are unlikely to reach the estimated 90 billion yen as the currency's rise has reduced the value of foreign bond holdings but the company will retain a nine yen dividend for 1986/87 a spokesman said Current profits in the year to end-March 1986 fell 382 pct from a year before to 15804 billion yen on sales of 3003 billion down 08 pct mainly due to the yen's appreciation Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1700 billion yen money traders said Of the total 300 billion yen will yield 38992 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24 The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 38990 pct in a 31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2 they said The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 38750 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 428/11 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end today the traders said The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 3200 billion yen imports of Japanese-made cars and electronic goods may upset West European officials but they generally seem prepared to stay on the sidelines in the latest trade row between the United States and Japan Japan's huge trade surplus is a sore point in West Europe as it is in the United States But US Charges of unfair trade practices involving computer microchips leave Europeans cold The European Community ran a 182 billion dlr trade deficit with Japan last year and seeks redress when it feels Japanese trade policy hurts Europeans diplomats and economists said But only in Britain has there been any suggestion of acting with the US To do something about Japan's huge trade surplus The EC is no more illiberal on trade issues than is the US said Martin Wolf director of studies at the Trade Policy Research Centre in London Basically their policies are pretty much the same But that did not mean Europe would support the US Or that the EC would climb on the bandwagon to take advantage of the US Dispute to press its own claims Wolf saidBasically Europeans have a different approach to trade problems he said In the US People talk about fair trade but not here he added In the US It all has to do with the general ethic of free competition while in Europe the general approach is that liberal trade is good because it makes countries rich Wolf said this basic US Attitude explains Washington's tendency to impose so-called countervailing duties - an import tax designed to offset advantages alleged to be unfair In Western Europe the approach to trade disputes tends to be to try to reach a settlement through negotiation Wolf said In the latest US-Japan trade row President Reagan has threatened to raise tariffs on selected Japanese electronic goods by as much as 300 mln dlrs alleging that Japan has failed to abide by a 1986 US-Japan pact on microchip trade But the European Community has challenged the agreement as a violation of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) practices that discriminates against its microchip producers It follows that they're not likely to rally to the side of the United States in defence of the agreement said Wolf Although British parliamentarians are pushing for a tough line on Japanese trade issues government officials in the rest of Europe told correspondents they would let the EC take the lead in any response to the US-Japan trade row A spokeswoman for the EC Commission in Brussels told there has been no change in the Community's position since a March 16 meeting of foreign ministers which sent a strong warning to Tokyo on trade imbalances In a statement issued after that meeting EC foreign ministers deplored Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for a greater Japanese effort to open up its markets EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq said after the talks there was a growing impatience with Japan in the EC Diplomats accredited to the EC in Brussels said they saw no signs of any immediate intention to impose any broad-ranging sanctions against Japan The EC is anxious to avoid provoking a trade war they said Instead the Community is trying to target problem areas in European trade with Japan including wines and spirits cosmetics and financial services and will continue talking to try to improve the situation the diplomats said In Britain where the government is angered over the difficulties telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless has faced in its bid to crack the Japanese market officials said last week that retaliatory action is being considered But government officials said last night We are not talking about days or weeks This is going to take time They said the government would consider its options at a cabinet meeting on Thursday but added that no final decisions were expected The main thing the British would threaten the Japan with is denial of access to London's booming financial markets government officials said in Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> firmed in morning trading on market speculation that its participation in a joint telecommunications venture in Japan would not be curtailed dealers said The company's shares were quoted at 372p at 0915 GMT compared with 364p last night The dealers said the speculation appeared to originate in Japan Cable has said it is resisting attempts by the Federation of Economic Organisations to merge two Japan-based telecommunications firms a move which would have cut Cable's stake from 20 pct in one to three pct in the merged unit However the dealers were uncertain exactly how the dispute over the shareholdings had been resolved British prime minister MargaretThatcher said in parliament last week that she regarded Cable and Wireless's participation in the Japanese venture as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market really was A spokesman for Cable said he was unaware if the speculation had any foundation Cable itself had issued no statement today on the issue liberalised financial markets are making it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar but they have several options other than normal intervention Bank of Japan sources said A senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks which have not been invoked since 1978 are all being considered But the time may not be ripe he said In this era of financial liberalisation it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan said another senior bank official But the first official said: From a technical viewpoint the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so A swap agreement an exchange of currency between two nations allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the other's currency in case of need If the Bank invokes such swaps both parties would announce the decision jointly said the first official The sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar But intervention is at least an option they said Further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 25 pct they said Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the US And other central banks if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet he said The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the US Federal Reserve and another 25 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks according to the sources Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in New York last week The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find it necessary but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end Columbia Co Ltd <NCOLT> will make a one-for-20 bonus stock issue on July 14 to pay back remaining premiums accumulated by 45 mln shares issued at market price through public placement in September 1980 a spokesman said The bonus issue will bring its outstanding capital shares to 6502 mln from 6192 mln as at March 31 1987 It is open to shareholders registered on May 31 Nippon Columbia's share price fell 20 to 1260 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today Tokyo stock market is likely to recover from its recent nervousness caused by the rise of the yen and the threat of a trade war with the US And resume its upward climb brokers polled by said President Reagan's threat to impose tariffs on Japanese electronics exports because of Japan's alleged refusal to abide by a bilateral agreement on computer chips was unlikely to cause the market to crash the brokers said on the eve of the new fiscal year starting April 1 The market today fell 6091 points to 2156666 Most brokers said Tokyo stocks should rise 10 to 15 pct in the coming fiscal year provided the yen does not rise too far against the dollar and US Sanctions do not escalate into an all-out trade war The market will continue to rise in the new fiscal year so long as we can avoid a free-fall in the dollar against the yen Nikko Securities' top analyst Kasuhiza Okamoto said However brokers said the market was unlikely to perform better than it has in the past year It will be very difficult to repeat last year's performance Last year was a bumper year that will live in the annals of the market said Kleinwort and Benson Ltd's securities analyst Peter Tasker The market rose 37 pct in the fiscal year just ending Tasker said Japan's discount rate which was cut five times this past fiscal year was so low that it forced funds from bank accounts into stocks buoying the market Nomura Securities Company brokers said that in the coming year the discount rate would probably be cut only once or twice and the inflow of funds would be slower Brokers said their optimism about the market was based on the current low interest rates the increasing propensity of the Japanese to save as the economy stagnates the imminent introduction of taxes on traditionally untaxed post office savings and the allure of quick and easy profits from stocks They said Japanese with money to spare and companies unwilling to invest in real plant and machinery in the present climate of stagnant growth would keep on snapping up stocks You just have to jump on the back of the winners and jump off quick if they start to lose one broker said Currently the Japanese discount rate is 25 pct Brokers predicted that among this year's winners would be shares which will benefit from domestic expansion Other winners would be stocks related to the fight against AIDS financial stocks in general food shares likely to gain from a government-initiated agricultural deregulation programme and issues supported by Japan's increased defense spending budget The themes this year are very clear said Nikko Securities' Okamoto He said Japan had to respond to international pressure to stimulate its domestic demand buy more imports and establish itself as a supply base of capital Brokers said banks and other financial institutions would be among the most popular shares this year We will have to consolidate our position as the capital supply base to the world said Okamoto noting Japan is the world's largest creditor nation Brokers said they expect the government this year to permit Japanese banks to start full-scale equity brokerage overseas They also expect it to relax financial practice laws in Japan Brokers said they expect subsidies to Japan's farmers to be slashed this year cutting the price of food Beneficiaries of such a move would include food processors and suppliers Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has set the expansion of domestic demand as a top priority this year and brokers said they envisaged higher profits for real estate and construction companies as well as many domestic manufacturers Brokers denied a suggestion that the market might be over-extended because the amount now invested 334000 billion yen was about the same as Japan's gross national product Barclays De Zoette and Wedd financial analyst Peter Morgan said the 20 pct tax on post office and bank deposits due to be levied this autumn would channel at least 2000 billion more yen into the stock market Brokers said they believe there would be more reports in the coming year of scientific discoveries to combat or diagnose Aquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and these would propel related companies' shares even higher than they had risen already AIDS stories suck individuals' money into the market Japanese people are paranoid about AIDS said one broker Co Ltd <RICTT> said it will set up a wholly-owned French subsidiary to produce plain paper copiers (PPC) from June 1988 Its UK subsidiary will also build a new PPC plant to start operations in September 1987 Ricoh said The French company <Ricoh Industry France SA> in Wettolsheim Haut-Rhin Alsace will produce PPCs at an initial monthly rate of about 2000 rising to between 4000 and 5000 units in a couple of years with initial investment of one billion yen Ricoh said The new company will create 100 jobs The company said its wholly-owned UK Subsidiary <Ricoh UK Products Ltd> in Telford which has produced office automation equipment such as PPCs sorters and facsimiles since April 1985 will invest 17 billion yen to build a new PPC plant It is due to start operation in September 1987 and increase output to 7000 per month from the present 2500 The new UK Plant will create 100 jobs to give a total of 360 jobs at the UK Subsidiary After both new plants reach full production 70 pct of Ricoh's total PPC to be sold in Europe will be supplied by those European units domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips from next month in line with government attempts to ward off US Trade sanctions company spokesmen said The moves might persuade the US To call off the sanctions despite obstacles to full implementation of the plans analysts said The tariffs will affect about 300 mln dlrs worth of products and are in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honour a semiconductor trade pact In announcing the sanctions last Friday President Reagan said Japan had not fulfilled its promise to halt predatory pricing and open Japan's market to foreign products But US Trade representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday on US Television that the US Is willing to drop the tariffs if Japan shows a clear indication that it will open its markets to US Goods The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has urged producers to slash output of the chips by 11 pct in the second quarter following a call to reduce production by more than 20 pct the previous quarter MITI also urged makers to boost chip imports Analysts said the moves could encourage Washington to cancel the tariffs ahead of next month's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan The US Wants to be satisfied It has rattled its sword and shown that it can and will do business said analyst Nick Edwards at Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd in Tokyo But analysts cautioned that although Japanese producers can cut output boosting imports -- the key to US Withdrawal of the sanctions -- is more difficult The US Does not have the low-end consumer IC's (integrated circuits) that the Japanese need for consumer products They're well supplied here said Richard May senior analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd in Tokyo The US Leads in production of medium and high-end IC's but Japanese makers are keen to develop their own high-end production skills the analysts said The Japanese must be prepared to trade some losses on semiconductors in return for free access to other areas said Edwards A spokesman for Hitachi Ltd <HITT> said the firm's reduced output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory (256K DRAM) was unrelated to MITI's efforts to ward off the trade sanctions Decreased production was a natural result of the company increasing output of one-mln bit DRAM's he said Company officials unveiled the following plans - - NEC Corp <NESIT> Japan's largest chipmaker plans to slash production of 256K DRAM semiconductors by 2941 pct to six mln per month from a monthly average of 85 mln last quarter In the year beginning April 1 NEC will boost chip imports which comprised some 20 pct of all NEC chip consumption the year before - Hitachi Ltd's <HITT> April output of 256K DRAM's will fall by 2593 pct to four mln compared to 54 mln in March The company is trying to boost imports but has not set a specific target Imports are currently very low - Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> will reduce April 256K DRAM production by 1667 pct to just over four mln and is considering ways to boost imports a company official said Toshiba has an agreement with Motorola Inc (MOTN) to sell the US Firm's chips in Japan The firms are planning a joint-venture production of memory chips in Sendai northern Japan - Mitsubishi Electric Corp (MIETT) will trim second quarter output by about 10 pct to between 55 mln to 56 mln chips compared to the first quarter Plans call for increased imports but an official said boosting imports will be difficult as it depends on sales demand - Fujitsu Ltd (ITSUT) will cut production in accord with MITI guidelines and boost imports from currently low levels - Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd (OKIET) will reduce April production by 10 pct from March's 32 mln Oki is studying ways to increase imports by 10 pct in the fiscal year beginning April 1 from the previous year's total of more than five billion yen a company official said shr 491 yen vs 659 Net 772

billion current 30 billion and sales 740 billion based on rationalisation efforts and expected market price increases in agricultural chemicals and petrochemical products following the recovery in world oil prices Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1700 billion yen money traders said Of the total 300 billion yen will yield 38992 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24 The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 38990 pct in a 31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2 they said The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 38750 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 428/11 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end today the traders said The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 3200 billion yen Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Japan plans to work out a drastic set of pump-priming measures immediately after Parliament passes the 1987/88 budget He told a Lower House budget committee the government is likely to consider a supplementary budget for fiscal 1987 and a new policy for the ceiling on budgetary requests by government agencies and ministries for 1988/89 The government had cut budgetary requests in the past five years in line with Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction policy of stopping the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990 The passage of the budget is expected in late May Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said in the same session Japan should use fiscal funds as much as possible to meet domestic and foreign demands for greater domestic growth Miyazawa said it appears difficult for the government to stop the deficit-financing bond issues by the targetted time Nakasone said he had instructed his Liberal Democratic Party to prepare its own economic package in time for his one-week visit to Washington starting on April 29 US Is willing to drop tariffs on Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an agreemement opening its markets to American goods US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview But there has to be a clear indication that they are willing to act he said Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the US Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are problems they have brought on themselves The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan he said My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction Although I can sympathise it's occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan The tarriffs announced on Friday by President Reagan will affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products only a tiny fraction of Japan's total exports to the US Even so Reagan's decision doesn't give us any joy We don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to Yeutter said Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include some difficult items on the agenda Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement Yeutter said Japan has stopped dumping chips in the US But it has failed to open its domestic markets to US-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries undercutting US Products he said Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime Tamura will meet representatives from 151 of the nation's largest companies next week and appeal to them to do their best to increase imports ministry officials said The meeting was unveiled as part of a plan to boost imports and help head off protectionist legislation in the US Senior officials from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry told reporters that such personal appeals appeared to have paid off in the past as Japanese imports of manufactured goods have climbed Leading domestic semiconductor makers will boost imports and cut production of key memory microchips next month in an attempt to help ward off US Trade sanctions company spokesmen said The officials also said they expect the government's new trade insurance law to boost imports and encourage Japanese companies to set up production facilities overseas Under the new law the government will insure Japanese companies who pre-pay for imports against loss arising from everything from war to bankruptcy of the foreign firm they are dealing with MITI estimated that it would help solve Japan's trade problem to the tune of about $10 billion dlrs a year and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> said proposals to resolve a dispute over entry to Japan's telecommunications market were not acceptable A company spokesman said the proposals appear to have been made in today's edition of the Japanese daily Asahi by Fumio Watanabe head of a telecommunications committee with the Federation of Economic Organisations However the suggestion still recommended a merger between the two consortia tendering for contracts and would give Cable a five pct stake more than the three pct originally proposed but less than the 20 pct it holds in its original venture he said The proposal would also offer a Cable nominee a seat on the board of the merged company The spokesman said he believed Japan should accept applications from the two rivals for fair review Earlier today Cable shares firmed on market speculation that the dispute -- which is being treated by Britain's government as a test case of how open the Japanese telecommunications market is -- was near settlement Cable shares at 1350 GMT were quoted at 375p compared with a close last night at 364p Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the United States and Japan must work to avert a possible trade war and he added that a trade war would not be in the interests of Britain Lawson told journalists that the prospects for the (UK) economy look very very good - providing we can avoid a trade war He stressed that a heavy responsiblity in different ways lies on Japan and the United States to ensure that we do avoid such a trade war Asked whether he believed such a trade war could be averted Lawson replied I very much hope so Britain last week warned that it would retaliate if Japan did not move soon to open its markets to outside competition Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave notice that the UK Would fight the Japanese government's attempt to prevent (Cable and Wireless Plc) (CAWLL) from taking a significant position in a new Japanese international telecommunications venture But British officials are now trying to dampen anti-Japanese rhetoric to try to keep developments under control The British Conservative government will on Thursday consider what legal options are available to it to try to increase UK Access to Japanese markets officials said Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the stock market overreacted to a US decision last week to proceed with tariffs on some Japanese computer products Speaking to reporters prior to testifying at a House Agriculture Committee hearing Yeutter said it is difficult to comprehend that a trade decision affecting only 300 mln dlrs in goods caused the stock market collapse yesterday I have a hunch a lot of other things were involved in that (stock market fall) including simple profit-taking Yeutter said Yeutter said Japan would be sending a senior official from its trade ministry to Washington next week for talks on the computer chip dispute We will be glad to have him here but that's not going to affect a decision that's already been made Yeutter said The decision announced last week would apply higher tariffs on a range of Japanese products in retaliation for the alleged failure of Tokyo to honor an agreement with the US on semiconductor trade Japanese ambassador to the US Suggested that Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone make efforts to present advanced' proposals on trade issues when he visits Washington next month Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone Kyodo News Service said Matsunaga also advised that the prime minister should be prepared to discuss US-Japan economic issues Matsunaga cited issues such as a US-Japan micro chip trade pact foreign access to the Kansai international airport project and a new international telecommunications firm Matsunaga returned on Sunday to report to Japanese leaders on recent US Developments over trade in preparation for Nakasone's visit to Washington April 29 to May 5 Kyodo quoted Nakasone as telling reporters after meeting the envoy I entirely accept what ambassador Matsunaga recommended Nakasone did not elaborate The US-Japan trade dispute intensified last week when President Ronald Reagan said the US Would impose heavy tariffs on Japanese imports in retaliation against alleged Japanese breach of the computer chip trade pact Meanwhile Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is to consider measures to boost imports and open up the Japanese market such as government purchase of supercomputers and expanding foreign access to the Kansai airport project party sources said The LDP international economic affairs council was responding to Nakasone's request for measures to reduce Japan's increasing trade surpluses with the US And Europe they said Corp said its Chevron USA Inc unit and Tokyo-based Nippon Oil Co Ltd agreed to conduct a joint-venture oil exploration and development program on selected Chevron leaseholds in the United States About 50 onshore and offshore exploratory wells will be drilled under the agreement and Chevron will be the operator of the project and pay some costs the company said It said Nippon will contribute an initial investment of more than 100 mln dlrs The Japanese government will also participate in the venture by providing financing to Nippon through the Japanese Oil Corp Chevron said It said drilling will begin during the second quarter Properties to be evaluated are located in California Colorado Kansas Oklahoma Mississippi Montana North Dakota Texas Utah and Wyoming along with Federal Outer Continental Shelf leases offshore Southern California and in the Gulf of Mexico Chevron said United States and Japan are not involved in a trade war despite US sanctions announced last week against Japanese semiconductors US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said In my judgement we're not even close to a trade war Yeutter told a House Agriculture Committee hearing Yeutter said if Japan takes action to honor its agreement with the US on semiconductor trade Then the retaliatory response will last a relatively short period Yeutter said Japan must stop dumping chips in third countries and buy more American computer chips threatened trade war between the United States and Japan is just the kind of shock that economists say could send world stock markets into a tailspin But they are not so sure if that would be a brief corrective dip or whether this week's falling share prices mark the start of a bear market It's the billion dollar question said Richard O'Brien economist at American Express International Bank in London Japan's trade surplus -- 927 billion dlrs last year -- has poured into share and bond markets around the world and funded a good chunk of the huge US Budget deficit Around a third of any new sale of US Treasury bonds has been bought by the Japanese However Japanese investors have lost money as the dollar falls and will lose more if the United States lets it fall further to cut the trade deficit The counterpart of improving the trade deficit either through a lower dollar or because the US Increases duties on Japanese electronic goods may be to hit the capital inflow which has financed the budget deficit And if the US Trade deficit does fall the Japanese will have less money to invest To entice US Investors to fill the gap that would be left if the Japanese stopped buying US Bonds interest rates would have to soar O'Brien said The subsequent shift from shares to bonds could cause major falls on the world stock markets A year ago we could be pretty confident about the markets said O'Brien Now it is much less certain Buoyant share prices are supposed to reflect a booming economy But the world economy with sluggish growth at best in the industrial nations a massive load of Third World debt and huge trade imbalances is not in good shape said O'Brien Nevertheless New York analyst William Raferty of Smith Barney Harris Upham said We're still in a bull market adding that corrections are a normal part of a rising market and The bear usually strikes slowly Economist Evelyn Brody at Morgan Grenfell and Co in London said the huge sums of money going through the world financial system will keep a floor under share and bond prices Although interest by the Japanese in putting their money in non-dollar denominated bonds and stocks has increased it's very difficult to see where else they can put their money than in US Dollars and especially the US Treasury (bond) market according to David Butcher a senior executive at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond operation in London He said the Japanese are paying much closer attention now to the French franc and West German mark In the longer run he worries about what trade tensions and the dollar's slide will mean for securities markets Reagan has reaffirmed his opposition to protectionism and his chief spokesman said trade sanctions imposed on Japan were unlikely to start a trade war We don't want to go down that road Reagan was quoted as telling Prime Minister Jacques Chirac after the visiting French official expressed concern about the rising tide of protectionist sentiment in the United States Later White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater defended the new sanctions against Japan and said administration officials do not believe this will result in a trade war It is the first time that the United States has taken an action of this type and it is significant but it is nothing to be alarmed about the presidential spokesman added We do not want protectionism  We do not want a trade war he said Fitzwater said the president was forced to act in the Japanese microchip case because Tokyo had failed to fulfill an agreement to make some corrections Noting that there are enormous pressures in the Congress and the land for the United States to take a tough stand he said This was a case where we felt we simply had to act Fitzwater said the decision to impose sanctions was well considered by this administration and not taken lightly While the White House official held open the possibility that Washington and Tokyo will settle their trade dispute he indicated a settlement probably would not come in time to head off the sanctions We are always open to negotations  Whether it (a settlement) could occur in time to prevent this (the sanctions) from going into effect is questionable at this point the spokesman said The sanctions take effect in mid-April Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlr sanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports despite any US Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was sure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade but I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17 He also said he did not think there would be a trade war with Japan because Japan had too much value in exports to the United States to risk such a war Those fears are unfounded he said He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the securities market was not due to fears of a trade war but fear of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact Market reaction was also due he said to the drop in the value of the dollar although trade issues did have some effect Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop in the market to trade sanctions were barking up the wrong tree He said the market observers will realize this shortly Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar of State Michael Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with high-level officials that will include discussions of a growing trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products He is the first high-level US official to visit Japan since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to 30 mln dls on Japanese electronic goods on April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip trade signed last September The trip is set for April 6-8 the state department said of State Michael Armacost will visit Tokyo next week for meetings with high-level officials that will include talks on the growing trade row over Japanese semiconductor electronics products He is the first high-level US official to visit Japan since President Reagan announced last week plans to impose tariffs worth up to 30 mln dlrs on Japanese electronic goods on April 17 in retaliation for Tokyo's alleged failure to live up to a pact on microchip trade signed last September Deputy State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said the trip is set for April 6 to 8 US-Japanese talks of this kind are regularly held each year at this time she told reporters The Armacost discussions with Deputy Foreign Minister Ryohei Murata and other senior Japanese officials will focus on US-Japanese foreign aid programs and political security issues of mutual concern she added Although an exchange of views on bilateral relations is expected the talks are not directly related to US-Japanese trade relations she insisted But in response to questions Oakley acknowledged that trade will be discussed Japan's 586 billion dlrs trade surplus with the United States last year has come under fire in Congress which is concerned about the loss of jobs to foreign competition and with the record 169 billion dlrs US Trade deficit in 1986 International Monetary Fund predicts that the industrial world will grow a sluggish 25 pct in 1987 a sharp drop from the more than three pct forecast six months ago monetary sources said The forecasts prepared by the IMF staff will form the basis of a debate on economic policy coordination by officials of top industrial nations at high-level meetings next week The sources said the IMF predicts an expansion of just 25 pct in the US shaving a full one point off its original 1987 forecast released last fall The figures will be discussed by the IMF's executive board before going to the IMF's policy-making Interim Committee here next week and may be subject to slight revision they said The Reagan administration has forecast 32 pct US economic growth this year while more pessimistic Fed officials are predicting 25 to three pct The sources said the IMF also predicts growth of around 25 pct in West Germany and 28 pct in Japan Washington has extracted promises from both West Germany and Japan that they will take measures to bolster their domestic economic growth to help reduce the massive gap between their huge trade surpluses and the record American trade deficit Poor economic growth figures in these two nations and the US are likely to do little to reassure currency markets In recent days the dollar has come under heavy selling pressure as markets have grown cynical that Bonn and Tokyo will take early action With no economic stimulus in sight financial markets have reduced the dollar's value to levels that are more likely to balance US trade monetary analysts say Monetary sources also said the IMF forecasts overall growth in developing nations of around three pct this year with developing countries in the western hemisphere -- the Caribbean Central and South America -- expanding 33 pct In its recent annual report the Inter-American Development Bank said Latin American nations need to expand between four and five pct this year to service their 382 billion dlrs of foreign debt Non-oil exporting Third World nations should achieve an expansion of around four per cent while oil exporting nations will average almost no growth at all the sources said Also short of the mark is the level of industrial country growth Western officials maintain the industrial world needs to expand at least three per cent annually -- against this year's initial IMF prediction of 25 pct -- in order to support the export drive of debtor nations Exports provide the indebted world which owes western creditors some 900 billion dlrs with its principal source of foreign exchange for debt repayments In other forecasts the IMF put overall global growth at about 28 pct and output in the seven leading industrial nations at around 25 pct The seven -- the United States Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada -- have become the main forum for coordination of medium-term economic policies in the industrial world The prediction for the seven is also around 25 pct growth in 1987 The Fund put Canadian growth at about 27 pct the French expansion at 29 pct and Britain at 28 pct The figures will be discussed as part of an overall debate on the World Economic Outlook and the US debt strategy by the Interim Committee Those talks are one of several meetings between top economic officials of industrial and developing nations during the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank Bank of Japan intervened in the market in the early afternoon buying dollars around 14730 yen and continuing to buy them as high as 14750 yen dealers said The Bank intervened just after the dollar started rising on buying by securities houses at around 14705 yen and hoped to accelerate the dollar's advance they said The dollar rose as high as 14750 yen of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said the present foreign exchange market instability will not last long as there is caution in the market regarding the rapid decline of the US Unit He told reporters the major currency nations are determined to continue their concerted intervention whenever necessary to stave off speculative dollar selling in line with their February 22 currency stability agreement in Paris Sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar

said the coincidence of the timing of the announcement by Toshiba with Cable's dispute could increase pressure from the UK On Japan However they noted that it was not a major move Toshiba already has

Taiwan dollar and US Import curbs on steel products industry sources said Last year Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344 vessels totalling 369 million light displacement tons (ldt) up on 165 of 297 million ldt in 1985 Lin Chung-jung a Taiwan Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman told China scrapped vessels of some 11 mln ldt last year while South Korea demolished ships of 910000 ldt he said Yao Liu president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co a leading shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung told We expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected decline in our steel product exports Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the US Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel product exports to the US To 120000 tonnes in the first half of 1987 from about 260000 tonnes in the first half of 1986 a Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against the US Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the US Dollar by the end of the year from 3423 today Yao said In comparison the won rose by about five pct and yuan remained stable during the same period he added We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China because foreign importers have switched their purchases he said Taiwan's steel exports to the US Japan and Southeast Asia slipped to 148000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987 from about 220000 tonnes a year earlier the Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said He said he expected further declines in later months but did not give figures Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> (MHI) and C Itoh and Co Ltd <CITTT> have decided to sell their combined 65 pct stake in Indonesia's <Pt Triguna Utama Machinery Industries> to <Caterpillar Tractor Co> spokesmen for the two Japanese companies said Triguna set up in 1982 is owned 40 pct by MHI and 25 pct by C Itoh and 35 pct by an Indonesian company It makes about 10 forklift trucks and a similar number of excavators each month in technological cooperation with MHI The spokesmen said the sale results from an expected restructuring later this year of the 50/50 Caterpillar/MHI joint venture Japanese company <Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd> formed in 1963 They said the venture will be renamed <Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi Ltd> and capitalised at 23 billion yen It will still be owned equally by MHI and Caterpillar and will be set up with the aim of centralising MHI's excavator business public offer by Glaverbel SA Europe's third biggest glassmaker of 755000 shares was more than 100 times oversubscribed a statement by banks and share dealers responsible for the issue said Glaverbel offered the shares at 1850 francs in an operation under which its parent company Asahi Glass Ltd <ASGLT> will reduce its participation to 567 pct from 736 pct previously Asahi is selling 500000 shares in Glaverbel while the company itself is issuing 340000 new shares Over 10 pct of the total available shares has been reserved for staff The statement said applicants for over 5000 shares will receive 30 There is a sliding scale which gives relatively modest applications a higher proportion and those who sought between 101 and 500 shares will receive five No shares will be given to applicants for fewer than 100 shares Glaverbel's net consolidated profit rose to 542 mln francs last year from 137 mln in 1985 and the group is to pay a 29 franc gross dividend its first for over 10 years As a result of the offer some 45 pct of Glaverbel's capital or two mln shares will be listed on the Brussels bourse Share dealers said some of the weakness on the bourse recently probably has been due to the amount of money tied up in Glaverbel applications Bank of Tokyo Ltd is issuing a 100 mln dlr convertible eurobond due March 31 2002 paying an indicated coupon of two pct and priced at par lead manager Bank of Tokyo International Ltd said The coupon will be fixed on April 8 while the conversion price and foreign exchange rate will be set on April 9 The selling concession is 1-1/2 pct while management and underwriting each pay 1/2 pct The issue is available in denominations of 5000 dlrs and is convertible from May 20 1987 until March 20 2002 The payment date is April 30 and there will be a short first coupon period proposed sales tax on gold transactions could put a damper on the Tokyo market and encourage a shift of trading to Hong Kong and Singapore senior vice president and Tokyo branch manager of Credit Suisse Paul Hofer told a press conference If you impose five pct on both buy and sell transactions Tokyo participants in the gold market could be out of business he said The tax would create such a spread that Japanese would be unable to compete in the international market he added How can the government really raise taxes if the system they impose is prohibitive of generating business? he said The government now imposes a 15 pct tax on physical trades exceeding 37500 yen for gold jewellery and coins and a 25 yen tax per 10000 yen on futures transactions gold dealers said The new five pct tax would be imposed on companies trading more than 100 mln yen a year and apply to paper gold trades gold deposits with banks and trading of gold bars as well as that of jewellery and coins dealers said However the tax would lower the rate on jewellery and coins to only five pct from the current 15 pct they said Hofer said in 1982 Switzerland had imposed a 56 pct gold turnover tax on Jan 1 1980 but abolished it on Oct 1 1986 A study by one of the Swiss banks showed that in early 1980 the first year of the tax the volume for all Swiss banks fell by up to 25 pct compared with 1978 and 1979 Hofer said Transactions of paper gold also fell up to 75 pct of the volume prior to imposition of the tax he said While gold transactions in Switzerland decreased the volume of trades outside the country particularly in London and Luxembourg increased between 10-25 pct Hofer said Japan is a major importer of gold buying a yearly average just under 200 tonnes gold dealers said Last year Japan imported about 600 tonnes of gold but the government had bought about 300 tonnes for minting coins to commemorate the 60th year of Emperor Hirohito's reign dealers said Gold trading in Tokyo is dominated mainly by Japanese trading companies while Credit Suisse is the major foreign participant Daily turnover in the Tokyo spot market ranges between one and 10 tonnes with the average around three tonnes while futures turnover amounts to about four tonnes gold dealers said All of us are concerned daily with the fact that the Tokyo market is growing that Japan is becoming one of the three major financial markets in the world  And in my personal opinion I think it would be a very big mistake to put a damper on this positive growth or developments by imposing such a tax Hofer said I don't think it fits the philosophy of an internationalising market he added Officials of several major Japanese trading houses attending the press conference said they supported Credit Suisse's call for the government not to impose the gold tax Japanese businessman Nobuyuki Wakaoji has been released after four months in captivity Presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Benigno told reporters the 53-year-old Mitsui and Co Ltd executive was freed yesterday and is being held in an undisclosed hospital He gave no further details on the release which was confirmed minutes earlier by a Mitsui

reiterated it has no plans to bow to pressure to give foreign telecommunications companies a major role in a planned new firm An official at the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications told the ministry's position is unchanged despite mounting pressure from London and Washington He declined comment on local press reports which said the ministry would back a plan aimed at cooling British anger on the issue The press reports said Fumio Watanabe head of the Federation of Economic Organisations would propose that Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc be given a five pct stake in a telecommunications firm and a seat on the board Watanabe was unavailable for comment He has the tacit backing of the government in his efforts to merge two telecommunications companies into one competitor to Kokusai Denwa Denshin (KDD) which has a monopoly on international telephone services here industry analysts said In London yesterday a Cable and Wireless spokesman said the latest reported proposals are unacceptable Cable and Wireless has a 20 pct stake in one of the two companies involved in the mooted merger British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has personally taken up the company's cause charging that Japan is discriminating against foreigners The United States also has vented its anger at what it sees as Japanese attempts to limit foreign participation Watanabe originally proposed Cable and Wireless be given up to 30 pct of the merged firm The press reports said this could be raised to 50 pct equal to the largest share of any Japanese firm Britain opposes the proposed merger International Inc said said it has agreed in principle to sell interests in its grocery products operations in Hong Kong Malaysia the Philippines Singapore Taiwan and Thailand to <Ajinomoto Co Inc> of Japan for 340 mln dlrs The company said the move will reduce Asian overhead and a substantial part of the proceeds will be used to reduce debt It said as part of the agreement its current direct investment in its existing non-consolidated joint venture with Ajinomoto will be converted into a cooperative arrangement for the long-term utilization of technology and trademarks The company said the change in the Japanese arrangement will give Ajinomoto full equity ownership while leaving CPC a continuing earnings stream and cash flow The transactions are subject to definitive agreements and government approvals CPC said not included in the 340 mln dlr consideration are proceeds from the sale of some smaller Asian investments including a 51 pct equity interest in an oat-based food venture to an Australian partner The company said the actions being taken under its restructuring program including the sale of its European corn wet milling business and other assets overhead reductions and other expense items and the Asian transactions will have a one-time positive effect on 1987 earnings CPC said Although the extent cannot yet be determined the company expects that 1987 earnings per share will increase by substantially more than the previously estimated 20 pct increase over 1986 In 1986 CPC earned 230 dlrs per share Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) charged Japan with lying and cheating in its trade practices The Japanese not to put too fine a point on it have lied cheated and otherwise misused tariff legislation theirs and ours And that's to give them the benefit of the doubt Leahy said The senator's remarks to the National Cattlemen's Association provoked laughter followed by applause Leahy said the Reagan

bigger role there Secretary James Baker said the US imposition of tariffs on Japanese goods over semiconductor trade does not signal the start of a trade war He also played down the significance of the precipitous stock market decline earlier this week I don't think this action should be interpreted in any way as the start of a trade war he said in response to a question from a House Appropriations subcommittee He said a drop in stock market prices of the magnitude experienced Monday was not so unusual I don't think it is particularly unusual to see those kinds of days on Wall Street Baker said Since Monday he added The stock market has rebounded rather vigorously He urged lawmakers to move cautiously on trade legislation to avoid overly protectionist moves which might aggravate world trade tensions You're not going to legislate this (trade) deficit away he told the panel crushers bought 5000 to 6000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for May shipment in export business overnight trade sources said and Japanese negotiators will hold emergency meetings next week to try to resolve their row over semiconductors but a US official said it was not likely the talks would delay the planned American sanctions Officials said the talks which were announced yesterday by US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter were being held under the emergency provisions of the US-Japanese semiconductor agreement A spokesman for Yeutter said officials of the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) would hold technical talks with US officials next Monday and Tuesday The spokesman Gary Holmes said that on Thursday and Friday Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith would meet with MITI vice president Makoto Kuroda But Holmes added do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions not to go into effect The 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese exports is set to go into effect on April following public hearings which begin in Washington on April 13 and Japanese negotiators will hold emergency meetings next week to try to resolve their row over semiconductors but a US official said it was not likely the talks would delay the planned American sanctions Officials said the talks which were announced yesterday by US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter were being held under the emergency provisions of the US-Japanese semiconductor

said that on Thursday and Friday Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith would meet with MITI vice president Makoto Kuroda Reagan's move to impose stiff tariffs on Japanese goods stems from deep US frustration over Japan's trade policy and he has no intention of calling off the sanctions trade analysts said US officials put down any idea of delaying imposing the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs despite seemingly contradictory comments by some Administration aides And they add a visit here next week by Japanese trade officials and a visit to Tokyo by a senior State Department official will likely do nothing to change US minds Do not expect the problem to be resolved or the sanctions not to go into effect said a senior US trade official Reagan last Friday announced that on April 17 he would raise tariffs on certain Japanese exports to penalize Japan for breaking a 1986 pact governing trade in semiconductors The United States says the Japanese have not lived up to their pledge to stop dumping semiconductors in third country markets at less than production costs or to open their home market to US semiconductors Semiconductors - tiny silicon memory chips - are integral components of modern electronic goods ranging from television sets and personal computers to guidance systems on aircraft Some US officials had hinted that the United States and Japan might come to terms on their semiconductor dispute in time to cancel the planned tariffs but this has now been dismissed by other senior officials They noted that negotiations over compliance with the pact had been going on for several months with little success Japanese firms this week announced plans to cut chip output and increase US chip imports but US officials said Japan's move was too late to stave off the American tariffs The tariffs are to be imposed after a period of public comment but Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and other officials have said neither the comment period or the US and Japanese trade talks will serve to delay the tariffs Baldrige predicted the dispute would be resolved but said I'm sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that while he hoped something could be done to hold off the sanctions it probably is not likely And US Trade Represenative Clayton Yeutter predicted that Japan would not be able to comply with the pact in time to hold off the new tariffs on goods including personal computers television sets power tools and electric motors Trade analysts said that in any case the US-Japanese semiconductor dispute was only one of many and trade frictions that will continue until Japan ended a policy of predatory pricing and opened its home market to foreign goods Other disputes include Japanese prevention of US firms from taking part in building a new eight billion dlr airport near Osaka and selling a wide variety of goods in Japan including many agriculture products A new trade row has now arisen over a Japanese decision to limit foreign participation in its telecommunication market US officials have said the American telecommunications market is open to foreign firms and it was only fair trade to open the Japanese market to 33 per cent foreign participation as Japan had previously agreed Britain has also protested the Japanese limitations American and Japanese negotiators are meeting to try to resolve the issue officials said but there was no sign of any early settlement of Nova Scotia> said it would apply for a common share listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange The bank

protested the Japanese limitations Motor Co Ltd of Japan said it expects that it was profitable in the second half ended yesterday after a first half operating loss of 17 billion yen Nissan chief financial officer Atsushi Muramatsu in a speech before an automotive seminar said he attributed the improvement to cost reductions and rationalizations of operations He said if exchange rates

setting up its own finance company to improve access to US and European capital markets appears to be relying less on corn from China Argentina and South Africa and more on supplies from the United States the US Agriculture Department said In its World Production and Trade report the department said in the past seven weeks reported US corn sales of nearly three mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the level during this period last year Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparent unwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world prices may have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United States for corn supplies the department said federal government and the Japanese trading company C Itoh and Co Ltd have signed a letter of understanding to try and boost trade ties between the two countries the Industry department said The two parties have agreed to encourage direct Japanese investment in Canada bilateral trade and more joint ventures and licensing accords

profits a bank official said The bank's plan also emphasises retail and medium and small-sized business operations he told Officials at <Fuji Bank Ltd> and <Mitsubishi Bank Ltd> outlined similar three-year plans They said lower interest rates and financial liberalisation have cut profits from dealings with big firms to nearly nothing They don't need us they can do their own financing one official said Sanwa Bank's plan forecasts that securities and international operations will contribute 40 pct of total operating profits by the end of the fiscal year ending March 1990 compared with 30 pct in fiscal 1985 the Sanwa official said Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions an official said Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 319 pct in April 1983 Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct equivalent to its own duties ministry sources said Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5908 in 1985 official statistics show However the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong US And European demand Due to concern about the farm trade row with the US Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties one said But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus which reached 586 billion dlrs in 1986 Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the US Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products international protocol to severely limit the use of industrial chemicals which are believed to damage the earth's protective ozone layer could be signed this year officials and scientists here said By the end of this year we should have an international protocol in place we can all be proud of US Environmental protection agency officer Bill Long told reporters The chemicals are chiefly chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used in refrigeration and making foam plastics solvents and aerosols The earth's upper ozone layer absorbs most of the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun The officials and scientists were meeting in Tokyo ahead of an international conference on the problem later this month in either Vienna or Geneva Long said Robert Watson a program manager for atmospheric problems at the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration said a protocol should demand an initial freeze on the use of CFCs by industry This should be followed by a gradual reduction in CFC volume until no CFC gases are released into the air he said The US Has already banned use of use CFCs in aerosols and Japan has asked for voluntary restraint but both still use CFCs in industrial processes Japanese businessman announced plans for a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc would be a core company However the plan unveiled by senior Federation of Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe does not specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have The share holdings of the core companies should be equal Watanabe said in a statement The actual percentage of shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies He said the eight core companies will provide directors for the firm The new company shall immediately set to work on the feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself Watanabe said Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups one of which included C and W seeking to compete against <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which now monopolizes Japan's overseas telephone business The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts A British source who declined to be identified further said the proposals could open the door to further talks between C and W <CAWLL> and the other firms involved C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which would have given it a five pct share in the new telecommunications firm compared to the less than three pct stake Watanabe originally proposed C and W has a 20 pct stake in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge The British source said the decision not to specify the exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door open for further discussion It's probably a sensible approach on their part the British source told C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a new cable between Japan and the US The proposed merger has sparked an international row with British government sources threatening retaliatory action against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices against foreign firms The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities companies operating in London The US Has also attacked the original merger plans saying that both rival consortia should be licensed Asked about participation by other US And European firms Watanabe said They will not be core companies but if they wish they could participate Under the Japanese law total foreign participation would be limited to one-third It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has the support of many influential backers and work within this for the realization of their ideas Watanabe told reporters The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp <MITTT> Mitsui and Co <MITST> Sumitomo Corp <SUMTT> Matsushita Electric Industrial Co <MCT> Toyota Motor Corp <TOYOT> C Itoh and Co <CITTT> and <Pacific Telesis International Inc> Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his final effort If it fails to satisfy the British government it will be up to the Japanese government to explain its position he said Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling trust banking sources said A Ministry official told earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales We are not legally authorized to do that he said A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions Finance Ministry has asked commercial banks to moderate their dollar sales JiJi News Agency reported quoting financial sources Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for comment The report also could not be confirmed by several bank dealers Earlier Japanese trust banking sources said the Ministry had asked them to moderate their dollar sales A Ministry official said earlier this week the ministry had recently surveyed currency transactions by investors but declined to say whether this aimed at reducing their dollar sales press reports said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on his controversial sales tax plan bowing to widespread opposition even within his own party The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax should be amended if there was anything wrong with it Officials were not immediately available for comment Until now Nakasone had vowed to press on with the tax as part of his plan to reform Japan's 36-year-old tax system But most Japanese newspapers and news agencies quoted him as saying today he would not foist the tax on the Japanese people if they hated it Opposition parties and some industry groups say the tax breaks Nakasone general election campaign promises last July and would discourage consumer spending needed to meet government pledges to try to stimulate economic growth Pressure for the tax to be amended or shelved is likely to increase soon before a first round of local elections due on April 12 political analysts said Resistance has spread from opposition parties and affected industries to the LDP Some 36 of Japan's 47 provincial governments have called for the plan to be scrapped or handled carefully government officials said Some leading LDP candidates for the local polls have not asked Nakasone to make a campaign speech for them as they fear his presence would weaken their position in the elections and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> said new proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a merged telecommunications firm to compete for telecommunications contracts did not remove the group's objections The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to compete against Japan's <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of the two consortia would be impracticable They are like oil and water he said The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have proposed that the two consortia band together The issue has been taken up by the British government as a test case on the openness of Japanese markets Watanabe's latest proposals said that the eight core companies of the new group should have equal share holdings but added that they could work out the precise percentages amongst themselves The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be offered a five pct stake up from an originally proposed three pct Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered the Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially the same Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at 374p is doing all it can to solve its trade problems with the United States but the two nations will remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in Japan's favour a senior official said So long as there is an external imbalance there will be trade friction and Harsh words between the two governments the Foreign Ministry official told reporters Last year Japan racked up a 515 billion dlr surplus with the United States and economists said they do not see it falling significantly any time soon Washington announced plans last week to slap up to 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods raising the spectre of a trade war between the two countries We take the current situation very seriously said the official who declined to be identified The basic stance of the Japanese government is to tackle the issues with all available resources The United States has accused Japan of reneging on an agreement that called on it to stop selling cut-price computer microchips in world markets and to try to import more American semiconductors Tokyo has denied the charges The Foreign Ministry official refused to rule out Japanese retaliation if America went ahead with its threatened tariffs in the middle of this month But he said that any response would be in accordance with international law and Japan's international obligations He added that both Japan and the United States must take account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the world economy leading economic organisations urged the Government to prepare drastic pump-priming measures even at the cost of shelving Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned tax reforms officials involved said Officials of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said in a meeting with government officials the Government should issue construction bonds as an emergency measure to prop up the economy Keidanren suggested that proceeds from sales of stocks in the newly-privatised Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp should also be used to stimulate the economy Keidanren Chairman Eishiro Saito said the dollar's fall below 150 yen would create huge unemployment and bankruptcies that could shake the foundation of the Japanese economy The Keidanren meeting coincided with a written request for drastic reflationary measures sent to the Government by the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Both organisations called for stepped-up Bank of Japan intervention to stabilise exchange rates Chamber head Noboru Gotoh told a press conference the awaited economic package should be powerful enough to push up Japan's Gross National Product (GNP) by about two pct Gotoh said the Government could cope with the present critical economic condition even if it put off its plan to stop the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990 The plan to reduce the fiscal budget is a pillar of Nakasone's fiscal reconstruction program Corp <TSBAT> said it regrets its plan to enter the UK Business facsimile and telephone market may be caught up in a diplomatic row over the position of Cable and Wireless Plc's <CAWLL> in the Japanese market Britain is considering how to retaliate against Japan's attempt to prevent Cable and Wireless from taking a major position in a Japanese international telecommunications venture As a matter of timing it is regrettable that this has been linked with the question of market access in Japan a Toshiba spokesman told <Toshiba Information Systems (UK) Ltd> a Toshiba subsidiary said yesterday it planned to enter the UK Market under the Toshiba own brand name and had applied for government approval to do so Toshiba has supplied equipment to UK Manufacturers for sale under their brand names since last year The Toshiba spokesman said the sale of such equipment was not comparable to Cable and Wireless' efforts to take a stake in the new Japanese telecommunications firm They are matters of a different category he said Bank of Japan intervened just after the Tokyo market opened buying dollars at around 14765 yen dealers said They were unsure of the amount of the central bank's purchasing but it seemed to prevent the dollar from weakening against the yen amid bearish sentiment for the US Currency they said The dollar opened at 14765 yen against 14720/30 in New York and 14690 at the close here yesterday is sending a three-man team to Washington to try to halt threatened trade sanctions that officials warn could spark a wave of anti-US Sentiment here The team will lay the groundwork for high-level emergency talks next week aimed at defusing an increasingly bitter row over trade in computer microchips officials said The sanctions are against the free trade system Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) director general Noboru Hatakeyama told reporters adding: If these measures are taken the atmosphere in Japan against the United States would become not so good as before Other officials were more blunt The US Action will have a significant impact on the growing anti-US Feeling (here) another MITI official said A senior Foreign Ministry official who declined to be identified told the US Threats have undercut those in the government who argue for conciliation There is a very strong argument in Japan that since the United States is imposing tariffs unilaterally why should we bother doing anything he said Anything we do we will be bashed The senior official sounded pessimistic about the likelihood of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defusing US Anger over Japanese trade practices when he visits Washington on April 29 I don't think trade friction will be solved all of a sudden (by the visit) he said Nakasone is widely expected to present a package of measures to President Reagan to help contain US Frustration over Japan's large trade surplus But the senior official played down those expectations is doing all it can to solve its trade problems with the United States but the two nations will remain at odds as long as the trade account is lopsided in Japan's favour a senior official said So long as there is an external imbalance there will be trade friction and Harsh words between the two governments the Foreign Ministry official told reporters Last year Japan racked up

the United States must take account of the impact of their dispute on their own and the world economy will arm itself earlier than hitherto planned with statutory powers to retaliate if decided necessary against Japanese banking and insurance companies on grounds that similar UK Based financial institutions do not enjoy the same market access in Japan government sources said The provisions being brought forward under the new Financial Services Act are reciprocity clauses 183 to 186 The powers will allow Britain to revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance businesses but will not affect licensed dealers in securities the sources said The news follows a cabinet meeting during which UK/Japanese trade problems were discussed The government decided on the steps at its cabinet meeting this morning and aims to maintain pressure to ensure that UK Firms be allowed the same access to Japanese markets as Japanese banking and insurance firms enjoy in London's financial areas government sources said One source said we want reciprocity in those fields And what we are saying is that if not then we can pull the plug and stop you from having an unfair and uncompetitive advantage The provisions being brought forward under the Financial Services Act will take effect after Easter or in around 21 days the sources said MORE at Toshiba <TSBAT> told reporters they have developed a kind of wire which can conduct electricity with no resistance and therefore no loss of power Although other firms have developed such superconductive materials Toshiba scientists said their discovery is the first that allows the material to be formed into a pliable wire Developing a superconducting material that works at room temperature with no resistance is the object of a frenetic worldwide scientific race The main applications would be in super powerful magnets small computers of immense power and speed electric transmission lines which use negligible power and electric generators which consume no power Toshiba said that it will probably be five years before it can incorporate superconductors in marketable machines But problems still have to be surmounted Present superconductors including Toshiba's need to be cooled to very low temperatures before they can pass electricity with no resistance This requires costly liguid gas coolants Superconductors developed to date transmit only small currents and cannot conduct alternating current only direct current government scientists said Toshiba which spent 1903 billion yen on research and development in the year ended March 31 1986 counts itself among the leading superconductor research companies in Japan manager of Toshiba's public relations Yuji Wakayama said The wires the company uses are a blend of yttrium barium and copper oxide and can conduct with no resistance at minus 1795 degrees centigrade Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist response in the United States Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the country if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very concernedand the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might be very serious Lyng told a group of US cattlemen Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter during a visit to Japan later this month will demand total elimination of the beef import quota by April 1988 The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may strengthen the US stance in farm trade negotiations Lyng said because Japan does not want a trade war with the US Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might retaliate against US products as a result of the semiconductor dispute They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us Lyng said adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan has more to lose in a trade war than the United States Lyng told the US cattlemen that the quota on Japanese beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice in food purchases He said in addition to beef the US will press for eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as well Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of US farm products principally grains and soybeans Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he doubted Japan could avoid the April 17 imposition of US tariffs on its semiconductor products The three high-level Japanese government representatives who would be coming here in the next few days to discuss the issue would probably be unable to show evidence of continued compliance with the semiconductor trade agreement Yeutter told reporters It would be impossible to provide evidence of compliance with the agreement based on sales of only a few days time he said Asked by reporters if the sanctions were 100 pct certain for April 17 he said One could never foreclose all options We have an obligation to listen to the arguments our trading partners make He said the length of the sanctions will be determined by Japan and Japanese semiconductor firms They would be lifted only when persuasive evidence provided demonstrates compliance he said Whether a few weeks or a few months depends on their actions Yeutter added press reports said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone has said he may compromise on his controversial sales tax plan bowing to widespread opposition even within his own party The reports said he told a meeting of supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party today the proposed five pct tax should be amended if

Europe or Japan was possible as a result of the US dollar's decline and the resulting drop in the US trade deficit Yeutter told the Senate Finance Committee They certainly have the macroeconomic policy tools to adjust to the US reduction in imports Asked if the US trade deficit was preventing them from going into a recession Yeutter replied that result was certainly possible and was the reason why they should adjust their monetary fiscal and tax policies Asked by Sen Bill Bradley (D-NJ) whether the US trade deficit would improve more if the value of the dollar dropped further Yeutter replied That should be a mathematical truism But he added that markets are more complicated than that He said he expected the current decline in the dollar to show up soon in the decline in the value of imports He expected the US would soon start importing less from Japan and Europe and would start exporting more to Europe where there's less rigidity on imports crushers bought 2000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for May shipment trade sources said They also reported rumors that Mexico may have purchased a sizeable quantity of Canadian flaxseed although no price or shipment details were available a time when Britain is threatening to revoke the license of Japanese banks in retaliation for restrictive trade practices Hong Kong is rolling out the welcome mat to Japan The British colony last week issued a banking licence to the Bank of Fukuoka Ltd making it the 24th Japanese bank here Japan has the largest banking contingent in Hong Kong followed by the US With 22 banks Eleven Japanese banks have representative offices here and Japanese institutions operate 34 deposit-taking companies (DTCs) Assistant banking commissioner KK Wong told There are no special favours towards the JapaneseBut because of Japan's strong economy and currency they easily meet our requirement on assets (14 billion US Dlrs) The Japanese control the largest share of assets of the financial institutions here but incorporated elsewhere with 9805 billion HK Dlrs at end-1986 or 575 pct of the total Hong Kong authorities welcome Japanese banks said Haruo Kimura assistant general manager of the Bank of Tokyo But the US And Britain are unhappy with the slow liberalisation of the Tokyo financial market Japanese bankers said Hong Kong offers good business opportunities especially in China trade to Japanese banks who are following their clients' international expansion As their clients become more international they have to keep up and follow them said Yutaka Toda Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's general manager here We can have access to local traders and regional corporations said Bank of Tokyo's Kimura We can also pick up business with China Bankers said more Japanese banks are on the way An influx of Japanese banks began in the late 1970s when the government lifted a moratorium on new licences But newcomers are allowed one branch each and only the Bank of Tokyo Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank have more than one branch Because of this limitation Japanese banks have mostly concentrated on wholesale business It is very difficult to compete with those giants such as the Hongkong Bank and the Bank of China said Kimura of the Bank of Tokyo Bank of Tokyo has the largest Japanese bank network here with seven branches while Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp and the Bank of China groups each have hundreds of branches To broaden their client and deposit base some Japanese banks have taken equity in local banks The latest such move was Dai-Ichi Kangyo's increase of its stake in Chekiang First Bank last year to 95 pct from 33 pct Tokai Bank Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Bank also have interests in small local banks But Mitsubishi not content with its single-branch licence and a 25 pct stake in the small Liu Chong Hing Bank bought Mercantile Bank Ltd's multi-branch licence early this year We will open one more branch in (Hong Kong's district of) Kowloon soon to better serve our clients on the other side of the harbour said Mitsubishi Bank general manager Takeshi Tange Their weakness in the retail market forces Japanese banks to rely on the interbank market for funding Government data show that despite their large share of total assets Japanese banks had only 544 billion dlrs in deposits at end-1986 or 171 pct of deposits of banks in Hong Kong incorporated elsewhere Most Japanese banks' international lendings in the region are booked in Hong Kong said a Japanese banker who declined to be named He said it is mainly for tax reasons adding that assets such as loans booked in Hong Kong are not subject to Japanese tax Japanese banks are barred by the Tokyo government from issuing Eurobonds but their Hong Kong subsidiaries can tap the Euromarket and lend the funds to the parent Bankers said this role could be undermined by a five pct capital adequacy ratio that goes into effect next year requiring many DTC's to increase their capital Many Japanese banks are seeking special treatment for their largely offshore operations or a different risk calculation for their assets I don't think this will stop them from coming here said a banker But it may mean they have to conduct some of their offshore funding operations elsewhere China International Trust and Investment Corp (CITIC) will issue a 30 billion yen 10-year bond on April 23 Daiwa Securities said as lead manager The samurai bond to be signed on on April 14 will be the first since an Asian Development Bank issue in February The coupon is expected to be around five pct Daiwa said The April Japanese government 10-year bond coupon has been set at 47 pct against five pct on the March bond Minister Mutsuki Kato said he will meet US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng here on April 17 and 20 to discuss bilateral farm trade issues Lyng will visit Tokyo from April 16 to 27 Kato told reporters after a cabinet meeting all topics ofconcern to the US Will be discussed such as trade in beef and oranges and import controls on farm products He said Shintaro Abe the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's executive council chairman would propose some unspecified measures in response to demands to ease import controls on US Farm products Kato declined to give any details Umpanki Co Ltd> said it is considering setting up a European unit to produce forklifts in view of the yen's rise and Japan's self-imposed restriction on forklift exports to the European Community (EC) Belgium Britain and France are candidates for the plant The company is negotiating with unspecified European makers and a decision is expected in August a spokesman said Toyo currently exports 40 pct of its annual production of 14000 to 15000 units Some 40 pct of exports go to the EC Overall Japanese forklift exports in calendar 1986 fell to 14005 from 15991 a year earlier United States is stepping up its bid to win a share of a multi-billion dollar project to build Japan's next jet fighter the FSX as the country's Defence Agency nears a decision agency sources said General Dynamics Corp <GDN> and McDonnell Douglas Corp <MDN> of the US Have separately suggested joint development of the FSX with Japanese firms Officials said the Agency was still studying the project but agency sources said the assessment was in the final stages The officials said the agency had received a briefing on a development proposal from General Dynamics to modify its F-16 jet The firm's team arrived here on March 30 They declined to elaborate on the briefing A team from McDonnell is arriving next Monday with a similar proposal based on its F/A-18 Hornet the Agency said A Pentagon team of about 10 experts will follow up with a one-week visit starting on April 11 to discuss the projected plane with the Agency the officials said Five major Japanese makers will also present briefings this month they said A spokesman for the group including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <MITHT> and Kawasaki Heavy Industries <KAWHT> declined to disclose details The agency has been studying three possibilities: development of a new fighter-bomber by Japanese makers with or without foreign participation modifying F-4EJ Phantoms the Agency now uses or purchase of a foreign aircraft The contract will be worth an estimated 1000 billion yen for 100 FSXs The agency plans to decide by June and seek initial research funds in the 1988 budget press reports said should increase foreign access to its farm products market while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture a government report said The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31 said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks will help prepare Japan to improve access Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which stressed the need for strict controls on some products to maintain self-sufficiency in food Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs down from 61 pct some 20 years ago official figures show The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly responsible for higher domestic prices it said The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has worsened working conditions among part-time farmers the paper said This could make it difficult to improve the industry's structure the paper said To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices to more reasonable levels Japan should try to restructure the the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it self-supporting it said Motor Co Ltd <SZMT> said it is recalling about 63000 of its compact 1300-cc SA-413 cars The cars produced between May 1984 and January 1987 need modifications because insufficient space between the fuel tube and the cooling fan switching coupler could cause them to catch fire under ordinary driving conditions the spokesman said Some 53100 of the cars affected were sold abroad NA> and <Tokyo Sogo Bank Ltd> the largest mutual loan and savings bank in the Tokyo area have signed an agreement to cooperate on retail banking a Tokyo Sogo spokesman said Citibank a subsidiary of Citicorp <CCI> plans to start retail banking in Japan and is expected to provide Tokyo Sogo with help in this area he told The two banks will exchange customer information and cooperate on credit card and foreign exchange business he said Korea will pay about 20 pct more for ethylene imported from Japan in the second quarter of the year because increased plastic production in both countries has boosted demand and tightened supplies chemical industry sources said South Korea has agreed to pay Japanese trading houses just over 400 dlrs C and F per tonne up from an average of 350 dlrs in the first quarter and throughout 1986 they said South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has risen to 17000 tonnes from 10000 last month and the country may face difficulties covering the extra volume they said <Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp> a producer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene will more than double its ethylene requirements to 9000 tonnes a month from 4000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this month the sources said <Honan Ethylene Corp's> import requirements have risen to 8000 tonnes a month from 6000 tonnes last year to meet strong demand from <Honan Petrochemical Co> which makes HDPE and ethylene glycol and <Hangyang Chemical> which produces low-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer they said But Japan's ethylene plants are already operating at almost full capacity of 45 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domestic demand the sources said And even if Japan had the additional ethylene there is a logistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vessels to ship it to Korea said one trading house source Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative sources to supply South Korea's needs including Saudi Arabia Qatar and Mexico they said But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has to be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to keep it in a liquid form they said Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene industry in order to cope with the additional demand despite rising prices trading house sources said South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase its ethylene production capacity by 500000 tonnes a year by the end of 1989 so the strong demand surge for imports is only a medium-term trend they said top Japanese official has insisted that the country was living up to its microchip pact with the US It cannot be thought nor should it be thought we are trying to dominate semiconductors Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) vice minister Makoto Kuroda said in a newspaper interview Kuroda who will head a Japanese team going to Washington next week for emergency talks on semiconductors told the Tokyo Shimbun that he would try his best to convince the United States of Japan's case Washington last week announced an imposition of tariffs on Japanese electronic products in retaliation for what it sees as Tokyo's failure to abide by the pact Under the agreement Japan would stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and try to buy more American chips Kuroda told the newspaper that Tokyo has already taken measures to back up the pact including production cutbacks While Japanese users are trying to increase chip imports Tokyo cannot guarantee the United States a specified share of what in Japan is a free market he said Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he recently talked with US Treasury James Baker over the telephone but declined to say what was discussed Miyazawa told reporters he talks with the US Treasury Secretary from time to time on economic issues The Yomiuri Shimbun daily newspaper reported Baker called Miyazawa early this week to warn him next week's Group of Seven talks would not be a success unless Japan expands domestic demand The newspaper quoted ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) sources Miyazawa told reporters the LDP will come up with a draft economic package to stimulate the economy before he leaves next week for Washington The Finance Minister leaves on April 7 to attend the IMF and World bank meetings Miyazawa did not say what would be in the LDP package Finance Ministry has asked Japanese commercial banks to moderate their dollar sales bank dealers said They said the Ministry had telephoned city and long-term banks earlier this week to make the request One dealer said this was the first time the Ministry had made such a request to commercial banks Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate comment Dealers said the Ministry has already asked institutional investors to reduce their sales of the dollar top Japanese official has insisted that the country was living up to its

checks on its fleet of Boeing Co <BA> 747-SR jumbo jets after a major defect was found in one of them last month an airline spokesman said Inspectors running a routine check found that one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to the wing had snapped due to metal fatigue he said He described the defect as major but said it was the first time such a fault had been found in the JAL fleet He said the part was sent to Boeing for examination but nothing had been heard from them yet A Boeing spokesman was not immediately available for comment JAL's entire fleet of eleven 747-SRs had been inspected but no similar defect was found the airline spokesman said should increase foreign access to its farm products market while encouraging further development of domestic agriculture a

reached in Paris in February had been successful and would be continued Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: The  Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has proven its worth and will also determine future developments Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar around 180 marks created problems for West Germany's exports He said studies by international organisations had made it clear that especially in the US And in Japan major efforts remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade balances via necessary corrections to economic policy No-one would benefit if after years of over-valuation the US Dollar fell into the other extreme that is strong under-valuation he said Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a swift agreement between the US And Japan concerning the current trade dispute over semi-conductors Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris currency accord Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not been published The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which central banks of the major industrialised countries would intervene Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully considered He said he had nothing further to add new concerns about inflation interest rate increases and trade confrontations finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss a deteriorating global debt and economic situation The meetings under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank come as interest rates are turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further upsetting bond and stock markets Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new assistance Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt last month The Banks have responded by laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans Separately French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac in a visit earlier this week with President Reagan sounded out the administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to the very poorest states The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be embraced by the developing countries There's interest on the part of some countries for looking at the support of the special problems of the very poorest countries because their position is so extreme a Reagan administration official said He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt initiative which called for new funding to help debtor countries grow out of their problems The largest industrial countries have been attempting to coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the decline of the dollar US trade and budget deficits and other problems At the same time the industrial countries see little evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund forecasts they will grow 25 pct The United States sees 32 pct growth for itself continuing its expansion for a fifth year and has asked other industrial countries to stimulate their economies These issues directly affect the debt problem and the ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their difficulties In recent years US markets have absorbed the exports of developing country allowing them to earn critical foreign exchange But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit running at a record 1698 billion dlrs and is pressing others to import more from developing countries The discussions from April six to 10 will be wide-ranging touching everything from interest rates to the impact of development loans on the environment according to monetary sources The talks will include an examination of trade protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on microchip products from Japan the sources said The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing There is concern that the action prompted by US charges that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair market value and has kept its own market closed to imports further undermining the international trading system At the same time the ministers will discuss the fundamental price weakness in basic commodities the export mainstay of many developing countries The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the United States Japan West Germany France and Britain -- will gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for further debate on economic policy coordination As part of the Paris accord surplus countries such as Japan agreed to stimulate their economies while America said it would reduce its federal budget deficit Other major issues of the meetings include a US bid to to have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American Development Bank strengthening the link between loans and economic policy changes in debtor nations Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more account of the environment when making loan for dams and other projects The new head of the Bank Barber Conable has said this issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization plan for the Bank now being prepared timecharter fixing by Soviet operators to cover USSR grain imports featured the freight market ship brokers said At least two fixtures were reported on Soviet account to lift EC grain with a 22000 tonner booked from Tilbury for a voyage via lower Baltic Sea and redelivery passing Skaw at 4000 dlrs daily and a 27000 tonner from Ceuta for a voyage via the UK And redelivery Skaw-Cape Passero at 4500 dlrs daily The Soviets also secured a 34000 tonner from Gibraltar for a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4500 dlrs daily and a 61000 tonner for similar business at 6750 dlrs daily Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be connected with Soviet grain including a 69000 tonner from Taranto for five to seven months at 6500 dlrs daily Similar fixing was reported yesterday at 6000 dlrs Other timecharter fixing included a 14000 tonner from Indonesia to the US Gulf at 2800 dlrs daily and a combined carrier of 75000 tonnes dw from the US Gulf to Italy at 9000 dlrs daily Severel vessels were booked from Antwerp-Hamburg range including a 61000 tonner bound for Singapore-Japan at 7500 dlrs daily and a 16000 tonner destined for west coast India at 5000 dlrs Grain fixing was much quieter out of the US Gulf with no fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent or Japan although tonnage was secured for at least five small corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25 dlrs Wheat from the River Plate and Buenos Aires to Sri Lanka received 26 dlrs Market talk suggested 11 dlrs had been paid for grain from the US North Pacific to Japan but no confirmation was available Fairly active grain fixing emerged out of the Continent however with maize covered from Nantes to Egypt at 15 dlrs and bagged flour from Greece to China at 27 dlrs Barley cargoes were arranged from Immingham to the Red Sea at 1725 dlrs and from Foynes to Jeddah at 1725 dlrs securities firms are spending millions of dollars to set up operations in Tokyo but many will end up losing money industry sources said For banks and securities firms eager to establish themselves as international players building a presence in Japan has become an imperative Thirty-six are already licensed to trade securities on the Tokyo Stock Exchange the world's second largest More than 50 are expected by year-end But as deregulation erodes brokers' profits and the global share-buying spree is predicted to subside only those securities traders with first-class financial muscle will survive the sources said There will be foreigners' fallout They come in here with too glib ideas about how they can survive said David Miller director and general manager of Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd's Tokyo branch Despite soaring share prices sharp falls in commissions on stock transactions have hurt even brokerages that came to Tokyo early Japanese equities are no longer a very profitable business The margins are nothing like they were two or three years ago Things are not as rosy as they may seem Miller said Publicly reported earnings of foreign securities houses in Japan for the half-year ended September 30 1986 showed Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd on top with profits of 17 billion yen Most other firms reported hefty gains over the year before But industry sources say the figures do not fully reveal the costs of running an international brokerage in the world's most expensive city Salary packages with free housing for novice analysts routinely run more than 100000 dlrs a year Miller whose firm had earnings of 14 billion yen for the half-year to September 1986 said costs for an operation strong enough to endure are 10 to 15 mln dlrs a year I'd be surprised if more than two or three were making money if they honestly accounted for their costs he said To bring commissions closer to world rates the Finance Ministry slashed fixed brokerage fees last year especially on large-lot deals In a few years all rates may be negotiated as they are in New York and London industry sources said Since last October's Big Bang deregulation of London's financial markets at least half the equity trading deals there have generated no commission income at all Stockbroking firms are unlikely to make money until some are forced out of business analysts said The first foreign firms to set up here especially the six admitted as members in February 1986 have an advantage over the latecomers they said The six are <Merrill Lynch Japan Inc> <Goldman Sachs International Corp> <Morgan Stanley International Inc> <Vickers Da Costa Ltd> <Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd> and <SG Warburg and Co (Japan) Ltd> The memberships which cost about five mln dlrs allow firms to execute their own trades and unlike houses with branch status avoid paying away 27 pct of their commissions to have member firms place trades Members can also communicate instantly with the exchange floor a vital source of information in a market that tends to follow the leader Sources said seven to 10 more seats on the exchange are likely to open up sometime in 1988 For non-member firms wrestling away market share from tenacious Japanese and foreign firms is costly and intangibles sometimes prove even more important than exchange membership Your name is better known if you're a member of the right club Miller said It's easier to hire  New people To inaugurate its Japan operation <SBCI Securities (Asia) Ltd> flew out the Basel Ballet last January for receptions in Tokyo and Osaka The firm 50 pct owned by <Swiss Bank Corp> gave guests gifts of Swiss chocolates and Swatch watches It's expensive but a party like that is a token of the serious way we regard our development in Tokyo SBCI's Tokyo branch manager Gregory Shenkman said To establish its position quickly SBCI hired a 26-strong research unit from <WI Carr (Overseas) Ltd>'s Tokyo office I was very lucky Shenkman said I was anticipating a considerable struggle to organically develop a research team I am not particularly optimistic for the prospects in the Japanese equity market for continental European banks who have little experience in equities outside their domestic equity market he said But the prospect of closing down operations may be worse One would be ill-advised to open here and close and then decide to open again two or three years later I'm not sure the Japansese community would respond well to that sort of attitude he said Babcock AG <DBCGF> said it agreed to cooperate with BASF AG <BASFF> and the Japanese firm Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <KAWHT> KHI in the field of technology designed to protect the environment Deutsche Babcock Anlagen AG would work with BASF to develop plants which would treat and burn industrial waste Another Babcock subsidary Vereinigte Kesselwerke AG VKW had struck an accord with KHI which would later be transformed into a licencing agreement The agreement with KHI involves construction and marketing by the Japanese company of an environmentally-safe system developed by VKW for burners in power station boilers Deutsche Babcock said No financial details of the cooperation were released and Japan remained deadlocked today over trade policies and political sources said the UK Government was pinning hopes for a breakthrough on the trip to Tokyo next week by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard Howard told he would try to promote understanding on trade issues during his trip which starts tomorrow Meanwhile Britain will re-examine a letter from Japan's prime minister promising his personal help for a solution to the row over a UK Firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's liberalised telecommunications market government sources said Tensions have risen following the decision by Britain to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial insitutions Britain had reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Japanese leader Yasuhiro Nakasone to UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher It had been seen as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> officials said But this view has been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of loud British anger they added Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless Plc The UK Government has made the issue a test case for Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside competition Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of attempts by Britain to achieve that Howard said I am not sure it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a personal interest in this problem I don't understand it to be closed at all During his visit to Tokyo Howard said I shall be talking to them about it (the letter) finding out exactly what they do mean about it and making it plain that we take a very serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as free as we allow acces to our markets to be He noted that under the new Financial Services Act Britain could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance institutions in London if UK Firms fail to get receive similar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon I hope it won't come to that and I don't think it will Howard added Officials involved in Howard's Tokyo itinerary said they had tried to arrange meetings with Japanese officials who were least likely to see trade issues in too a parochial a light Customs Bureau has begun to levy on bond on certain Japanese goods pending a final decision by President Reagan on April 17 on imposing the planned 100 pct tariff on the shipments the bureau said A bureau official said bonding began on March 31 and if the penalties are imposed as expected after a period of comment they will retroactive to that date The penalties are to be levied on variety of electronic items in retaliation for Japan's failure to comply with a July 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in third nations and to open its home market to US goods crushers bought 4000 to 5000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business

British anger they added Howard said he would use his trip to push for a bigger role in Japan's telecommunications industry for Cable and Wireless Plc The UK Government has made the issue a test case for Japan's willingness to open its markets adequately to outside competition Asked whether the letter from Nakasone was a rejection of attempts by Britain to achieve that Howard said I am not sure it is correct to regard Mr Nakasone's letter as a rejection of Mrs Thatcher's request of him - and it says he is taking a personal interest in this problem I don't understand it to be closed at all Howard added that during his Tokyo visit he would be talking to them about it (the letter) finding out exactly what they do mean about it and making it plain that we take a very serious view of the fact that access to Japanese markets is not as free as we allow access to our markets to be He noted that under the new Financial Services Act Britain could revoke or deny licences to Japanese banking and insurance institutions in London if UK Firms fail to receive similar treatment in financial markets in Japan soon I hope it won't come to that and I don't think it will Howard added During the trip Howard will meet officials in the Tokyo Stock Exchange the Ministry of Finance the Trade Ministry and Posts and Telecommunications Minister Shunjiro Karasawa Karasawa is regarded as behind opposition to any significant role for Cable and Wireless in the Japanese telecommunications industry Share prices on the London Stock Exchange were undermined again today by fears of a possible UK/Japanese trade war This was despite denials by Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon that Britain was on the verge of a trade war He told a meeting of insurance brokers today that Britain believed a sensible solution could be found which would open Japanese markets to British goods Government officials were at pains today to deny that Britain had set a deadline of three weeks for Japan to promise similar access to its financial markets to UK-based financial firms as that enjoyed in London by equivalent Japanese firms They said that Department of Trade and Industry officials had said yesterday that the measures against Japanese financial institutions could be imposed from then but that this did not necessarily constitute a deadline Experts believe Britain would lose out by acting against Japanese banks insurance and investment institutions But despite the danger of Japanese firms taking their trade elsewhere in Europe Howard said he did not expect the move to backfire He said in a radio interview today it is true that we benefit from their presence - but they would not want to lose those advantages And I am sure they are making their views plain to the Japanese government on this matter Howard who will also be visiting South Korea before returning to London on April 11 said his trip to Tokyo was planned well before the current trade row Howard said his talks with Japanese officials would also include ways of jointly combating financial fraud in global markets with Japanese officials This would be done through a cooperation between national regulatory bodies He said a memorandum of understanding for exchanging information to combat financial fraud would be sought with Japan on terms similar to one signed last autumn between Britain and the United States and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports But US officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17 The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized The penalties would be retroactive to March 31 Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and Friday Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13 The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include Shigeru Muraoka director-general of international trade policy of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and Masashi Yamamoto deputy director-general of the information and machinery bureau Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima director of the Japan office of the US Trade Representative's Office and Jim Gradoville of trade representative's office of industry and services The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be headed by Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith and MITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda UK government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard political sources said Howard who leaves for Japan tomorrow told he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit Meanwhile Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a UK firm's bid to win a significant role in Japan's telecommunications market government sources said Tensions have risen following Britain's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc government officials said But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger they added Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan might spread throughout the industrial world But in an interview with Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth We have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn't close at the same time he said He said the US action against Japan was a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy The interview came just before next week's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund Referring to Brazil's recent interest payments moratorium Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched He said the Bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform The Bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government's role in the economy We're comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio Conable said He made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time He noted the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt Conable is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the US strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank's organization to be completed in the next several weeks He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable and is being closely-watched by the agency's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow Conable said However he said I don't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose He said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency the International Monetary Fund was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues On a personal level Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that I don't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development He added so I don't feel a great calling to personalize the institution On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 124 billion dlrs for Bank's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the Sub-Sahara during next week's meetings Co <BA> is trying to find out what caused an engine brace to snap on one of Japan Air Line's 747-SR jumbo jets a spokesman for the airplane manufacturer said We know about the problem and we have provided a service advisory to operators of 747s said the spokesman We are not advising any massive inspections at this time The advisory alerts operators of the jumbo jets that a problem has occurred and under what circumstances but it does not recommend any action A 'service bulletin' would be sent out if there is anything they should be concerned about the spokesman said A JAL spokesman in Toyko said inspectors making a routine check found one of three diagonal braces attaching an engine to the wing of a 747-SR had snapped due to metal fatigue The airlines said it had ordered an inspection of all 11 of its 747-SR's The plane is a full-sized jumbo jet that has been modified slightly to handle short-haul routes in Japan mainly between Tokyo and Osaka The jetliners have beefed-up landing gear to accommodate a higher-than-normal number of landings and takeoffs Boeing's spokesman said only JAL and All Nippon Airlines use the 747-SR JAL took delivery of its first 747-SR in 1973 and purchased two more last year He said the braces had been shipped to a Boeing plant near Seattle where they were being inspected Affairs Minister Michael Howard said he will use a coming trip to Tokyo to seek a memorandum of understanding between Britain and Japan on the exchange of information to fight fraud in world financial markets He told journalists that he would be seeking an agreement with Japan similar to one struck last autumn between the UK Department of Trade and Industry on the one hand and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the other Market sources have persistently speculated that it was information passed on to the UK By the SEC through their pact that triggered the DTI's investigations into (Guinness Plc's) <GUINL> takeover of <Distillers Co Plc> last year The probe launched in December triggered the resignation of some of Guinness' senior management including Chairman Ernest Saunders The Trade department however has never confirmed this and has yet to state what its investigation actually concerns Japanese government investigation team believes that faulty repairs by Boeing Co caused the worst single plane crash in history one of the team said Boeing Co is the manufacturer of the Japan Air Lines 747 jumbo jet which crashed into a mountain in Japan on August 12 1985 killing 520 people There were only four survivors A Boeing spokesman contacted by telephone at the firm's headquarters in Seattle Washington told the firm would probably have no comment to make until the Japanese investigation team's report was officially released The team investigator a Japanese Transport Ministry official who declined to be identified said a failure by Japanese aircraft inspectors to check the repair work done on the plane by a Boeing team had provoked an internal debate in the Ministry over inspection procedures The Ministry official told that a report by his team which has already been sent in draft form to the US National Transportation Safety Board for comment should be released in late May Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the pertinent authorities Asked on Thursday about Boeing's role in the crash a Ministry spokesman declined comment On September 6 1985 Boeing issued an official statement saying that repairs it had undertaken on the doomed Japan Air Lines plane in 1978 were faulty However no official direct connection was then made between the faulty repairs and the crash The Japanese investigation team says in its draft report that it believes those faulty repairs were the cause of the 1985 accident the investigator said The Boeing statement after the crash said: Examination of the wreckage the flight data recorder readout the cockpit voice recorder and interviews with the surviving off-duty flight attendant indicate that decompression occurred in flight due to a rupture of the aft pressure bulkhead The Boeing examination of the bulkhead at the site of the crash has revealed that a relatively small section of the bulkhead splice approximately 17 per cent was not correctly assembled during repairs which Boeing made after a 1978 landing accident the statement said The repairs were required after a 1978 landing accident at Osaka airport in western Japan in which the plane's tail scraped the runway The Japanese report also mentions the government inspectors who in 1978 signed a certificate of airworthiness approving the repairs he said Police had investigated four inspectors including one man who two weeks ago killed himself by drinking insecticide after four days of police questioning None of the four had looked at Boeing's repair work the investigator said corporate affairs minister left for Tokyo saying he planned to present Japanese authorities with a timetable for obtaining fair market access for his country's goods and financial services I should be expecting a positive response to that timetable the minister Michael Howard said He said the response was expected by next month but reiterated his belief that Britain would not have to invoke a new law allowing a ban on Japan's banks and insurance firms from trading in London if it failed to reciprocate in Tokyo I don't think that talk of a trade war is justified in any event  I think the Japanese are going to realize that it's important that access should be available The Conservative British government decided on Thursday to bring forward legislation allowing the possible imposition of a ban against foreign countries failing to allow reciprocal market access It is due to take effect in three weeks Twenty-nine Japanese banks nine insurance companies and 58 securities houses currently operate in London while only five British banks and eight securities firms are licensed in Japan We are sure reasonable men will come to a reasonable solution said a spokesman for <Nomura International> the biggest of the Japanese securities firms in London which could be targetted The government decided to rush provisions of the Financial Services Act into effect largely in response to the failure of Cable and Wireless <CAWLL> to gain what it considers a satisfactory stake in one of two consortia seeking to compete in Japan's international telephone business However British economists say the use of financial services countermeasures in the trade dispute would hurt Britain more than Japan The British press expressed concern that was Howard was travelling with counterproductive or irrelevant ammunition The Daily Telegraph commented that an unfortunate minister was being despatched to Tokyo armed with a pistol pointing at his own foot The Financial Times urged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to avoid provoking a nasty backlash from Tokyo Japan appeared to be making no concessions ahead of Howard's trip and Trade and Industry Secretary Paul Channon on Friday sought to dispel some of the growing concern over the dispute We don't want a trade war he said We're not interested in trade wars But Channon made plain the government was determined that British firms should have the same opportunites in Japan as Japanese firms have in Britain and wanted a timetable set for this purpose Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary committee he expects major nations to reafffirm the currency pact they struck in Paris when they meet this week in Washington political sources said The Minister also was quoted as saying he expects major nations to take coordinated action to ensure exchange rate stability Finance Ministry officials were unavailable for immediate comment In Paris on February 22 six nations - Britain Canada France Japan the US And West Germany - pledged to cooperate to hold their currencies stable Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the dispute between the US And Japan over computer chips will not develop into a full-scale trade war I think both sides will try and make sure that this doesn't start a trade war -- as a matter of fact I'm positive that there won't be a trade war with Japan Baldrige said in a television interview President Reagan last week imposed penalties over Japan's alleged failure to adhere to a July 1986 agreement to stop selling semiconductors in third countries at below cost and to open its own market to US-made chips Despite Tokyo's displeasure with the penalties Baldrige said Japan would refrain from taking retaliatory steps that would lead to a trade war largely because Japan itself would have the most to lose in such a conflict Japan I think will -- because they have the means to do it -- face up to the fact that as the second largest industrial trading power in the world they have to live up to their responsibilities of free trade he said I think we'll work our way out of this he added It's not going to be easy But I guarantee you we're not going to have a trade war US Administration under Congressional pressure to cut the trade deficit will urge Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington monetary sources said The US Will also try to develop proposals made at the 1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the Paris Accord are more binding they said Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect US Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast enough to curb their huge trade surpluses they added Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the meeting which will be attended by West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada as well as the US And Japan the sources said The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to announce a stimulative packagethe better it is for Japan and for the exchange markets in general one of the sources said Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement in which West Germany and Japan made their commitments will be renewed by the industrial countries this week Other US Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made setting up stimulus measures The US Will tell its partners that it expects a further substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with Congress this year the sources said Washington would like its economic partners to establish specific economic policy goals Sharp deviations from the set objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on appropriate corrective action they added The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports and the US Cutting its budget deficit thereby depressing its demand for imports But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck the sources said Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall against the yen reflected the US-Japanese dispute over semi-conductor trade which resulted in US Tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures aimed particularly at Japan has strengthened the sources said Metal Industries Ltd <SMITT> said it and four other firms jointly concluded negotiations to export a total of over 400000 tonnes of seamless pipes in the six months to end-September to China and the Soviet Union Export prices for that period for both countries were set 100 to 150 yen per tonne higher than previous contracted prices due to the yen's gains against the dollar it said Contracted export volume for China is likely to be over 200000 tonnes against 350000 for Oct 1986-March 1987 and 420000 for April-Sept 1986 and for the Soviet Union over 200000 tonnes No direct Soviet comparison was available oil traders generally expect oil prices to remain steady through June when the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' (Opec) meeting is scheduled to take place Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a month despite coming under considerable pressure in February as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly resist paying official prices trade sources said Despite these attempts spot crude rose steadily to stabilize around OPEC's 18 dlr a barrel target they said Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its 158 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members would submit to pressure to discount prices oil traders said However Opec's discipline in holding its price and output targets eventually forced many of the buyers back they said Countries such as Qatar Iran and Iraq refused to bend to demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting from Japanese buyers The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels to store its production rather than cut its prices they said Opec's March production was 146 mln bpd 12 mln below its ceiling with Saudi Arabia's output just below 30 mln bpd compared to its Opec quota of 4133 mln bpd the Middle East Economic Survey estimated Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to destroy the market an oil trader in Tokyo said Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes but these trades have not generated sufficient volume to depress the market he said The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20 to 25 cts below official prices so resistance to buying crude under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be weaker traders said Indonesia's Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output volume at 158 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly or raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987 Holdings Plc <RTRSL> said it plans to seek a listing for its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange later this year subject to shareholder approval The Tokyo listing will create a 24-hour market for the stock A company spokesman said the listing is expected in the final quarter Sponsorship for the listing will be disclosed after shareholder approval is sought on April 29 B ordinary shares are currently listed on the London Stock Exchange while American Depositary Shares representing six B shares are quoted on NASDAQ in New York The company said a Tokyo listing would also increase its profile in Far Eastern markets has maintained a news

Jiji services through the monitor and through the Composite Information System CIS The Monitor Dealing Service was launched in Japan in 1986 top Japanese businessman said the country's four largest economic organizations will soon present to the government a set of proposals to expand domestic demand Eishiro Saito Chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) told a news conference the government should draw up a package of economic measures totalling more than 5000 billion yen Saito said the government's package should include plans to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products and to lift tariffs on industrial products Leading industrialised countries should also step up concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates Saito said The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren the Japan Federation of Employers' Association the Japan Committee for Economic Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Saito said Japan should stop paying only lip service to its pledges to open its markets The proposed measures should be undertaken by increased fiscal spending he added Electric Industry Co Ltd> may import car telephones made by its 100 pct US Subsidiary <Oki America Inc> for sale in Japan an Oki spokesman said The firm would like to import the car phones which are made according to a system developed jointly by Motorola Inc <MOT> of the US And Oki Electric the spokesman said A final decision will hinge on obtaining approval from Japan's Post and Telecommunications Ministry and whether or not it is feasible to convert the models to meet Japanese specifications he said Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is considering buying a US-built supercomputer worth three to four billion yen but a final decision and funding have yet to be determined MITI said The Cray II computer made by Cray Research Inc <CYR> would be used jointly by nine MITI research institutes in Tsukuba northeast of Tokyo a MITI official told Its purchase would be in line with MITI's goal of boosting imports he said Funds for the supercomputer are not included in the fiscal 1987 budget currently stalled in parliament Funds could be provided in a supplementary budget likely to be introduced this autumn the official said The US Has strongly urged Japan to open its public sector to sales of US Supercomputers and the complaint is a key issue in current US-Japan trade friction One year before it was privatised in April 1985 <Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp> (NTT) bought a Cray supercomputer an NTT official said the only public sector purchase of a US Supercomputer to date Bank of Japan intervened in early afternoon Tokyo trading to support the dollar against active selling by institutional investors and speculative selling by overseas operators dealers said The central bank had also bought dollars against the yen in morning trade The dollar traded around 14520/30 yen when trading began in the afternoon here and weakened only slightly the dealers said ruling Liberal Democratic Party has drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a supplementary budget of more than 5000 billion yen a senior party official said It also urged the government to concentrate in the first half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record proportion of the year's public works spending he said The LDP also suggested the government review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment in public works projects presented by individual ministries he added But the LDP official said the government should not abandon its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990 These measures should be treated as an emergency partly because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external trade imbalance with the US He said The guidelines will be explained to the US This week when Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting he added The official the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's Chairman Masayoshi Ito told a press conference the proposed supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than August but before November The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29 for talks with President Reagan Ito said The full government-endorsed economic package is expected to be announced in late May The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88 half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget Ito said The previous record for the rate was 775 pct in 1986/87 Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks An LDP statement said the government should use the additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise Finance Ministry auctioned 280 billion yen of four-year government notes the first auction of fiscal 1987 which started on April 1 The coupon was set at

pct in a 20-day repurchase pact maturing on April 28 they said The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 38125 pct one-month and 37500 pct three-week commercial bill discount rates today

year import the same cars from Japan and Thailand which has a lower labour cost advantage The officials said Mitsubishi's decision to move its production to Thailand also stemmed from the fact that

said he would support the issuance of Reagan bonds yen-denominated US Government securities if it was considered appropriate a Japanese daily paper reported The Sankei Shimbun quoted Sumita as saying in an interview It (Reagan bond) is a very feasible idea speaking in the context of the effectiveness of such bonds in halting the dollar's decline Asked how he would respond to the idea if it were brought up at any Group of Five meeting in Washington later this week the paper quoted him as saying I will back it up But Sumita said the market still has confidence in the dollar and one must be careful in associating the current dollar decline with anything like a free fall the paper said In 1978 the administration of then president Jimmy Carter floated government securities worth four billion dlrs in marks and Swiss francs to try to halt the the dollar's depreciation A Bank of Japan spokesman confirmed that the newspaper report was basically correct But a senior central bank official told that as far as he knew the idea was not being seriously considered now either in the US Or in Japan strong earthquake registering 69 on the open-ended Richter scale jolted central and northern Japan the Meteorological Agency said but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage An agency statement estimated the epicentre of the quake which struck at 9:40 AM (0040 GMT) as

of Tokyo On March 18 a quake also registering 69 on the Richter scale hit southwest Japan killing two people Earthquakes of force six on the Richter scale are capable of causing widespread heavy damage in a populated area The agency issued but soon cancelled a tidal-wave warning for the Pacific coastline of central and northern Japan The Shinkansen bullet train linking Tokyo and northern Morioka stopped running Services will be suspended for several hours while workers check the tracks railway officials told A spokesman for Fukushima police told they had not received any damage reports even from the coastal town of Onahama which registered the maximum intensity He described the shaking as very strong banks in West Germany are reassessing their positions after a number of changes in the markets and the regulatory environment that have dampened a once-euphoric enthusiasm for expansion here Banking sources said the most important changes were plans to bring securities holdings into capital lending ratios the first such move in a major financial centre This could place a serious burden on several foreign banks particularly those active in primary and secondary bond markets Foreign banks had much lower equity and reserve capital than most domestic banks Senior banking sources said talks between the Bundesbank and the banking supervisory office over bringing securities -- primarily bonds -- under banking laws governing capital ratios were in progress Although no date had been set for imposition banks as early as this year may be obliged to bring bonds under 1985 rules that limit bank lending to 18 times shareholders equity and reserves Although other national regulatory authorities are known to be considering similar steps in light of growing securitisation of debt previously in the balance sheet Germany with its tradition of prudence may be the first Brian Kissack president of the Foreign Banks Association told It's not a positive sign It could cause certain people who are not in (West Germany) to query whether it was as attractive to get in now Larger banks may begin to use global networks to pass on holdings in mark securities to other centres which had less stringent ratios taking business out of the country he added But sources said foreign banks faced a host of other practical problems as well These included -- the apparent unwillingness of the Bonn government to make an early move to abolish the stock exchange turnover tax -- signs that London's Big Bang may have deeper implications for German securities trading than first thought -- difficulty in finding experienced securities professionals to staff new subsidiaries -- growing pressure on commercial banking margins that is forcing widespread retrenchment and refocusing of activities -- the threat of having to face a renewed push for market share by the largest and most powerful Japanese banks By leaving the stock exchange turnover tax out of the initial negotiating session of the incoming federal coalition government Bonn had dashed hopes it would soon be abolished The tax is 025 pct on each side of a securities trade by a non-bank but it is not levied on public authority bonds This extra cost particularly for finely-priced instruments such as floating rate notes had kept much mark securities business firmly in the City awaiting a change But aside from this London was more active than domestic houses had expected Large US British Japanese and Swiss investors often preferred to execute block trades -- 50000 shares and up -- with City market makers who could absorb at least some of the paper in their own positions diminishing the immediate impact on the share price Most German brokers and banks pass trades direct to the exchange floor cutting profits or adding to costs Bank in Liechstenstein (Frankfurt) GmbH board member Michael Zapf said London's share of German securities business done was causing foreign banks without German units to weigh whether establishment costs involved were worth the returns Additional signs that London market makers may move into secondary level stocks had added to this concern he said Now plans by many foreign banks to transfer mark securities trading entirely to newly established mainly Frankfurt-based units were being reassessed sources said The continuing existence of the stock exchange tax had also effectively prevented the birth of a short-term mark paper market in certificates of deposit or commercial paper Many US Investment and money centre banks in particular were hoping experience in these would provide the lever to prise open tight credit relationships between companies and their domestic house banks At the moment US Investment banks are expanding fastest here A unit of Salomon Inc <SBN> began last summer and Morgan Stanley Group Inc <MSN> is currently fitting out offices probably for a summer start to business A unit of <Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co> should begin operations toward year end Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MERN> and Shearson Lehman Brothers are known to be weighing conversion of current small operations to full-standing units But expansion had been hampered by the lack of experienced personnel in a hitherto fairly small market The big three Swiss banks which arrived between late 1985 and first half 1986 have been steadily building up securities departments taking staff equally from domestic and foreign competitors The two US Banks longest established here Citibank AG and Chase Bank AG had been particularly hard hit Both banks recently announced plans to cut back commercial activities and shut down German branch offices on orders from head office In the competitive environment return on assets employed was insufficient to meet requirements sources said But the weakening attraction of Financial Centre Germany was unlikely to deter major Japanese banks from setting up full subsidiaries when the Bundesbank gives the green light for mark eurobond lead management probably around third quarter 1987 Once banks such as Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd <DIKBT> and Sumitomo Bank Ltd <SUMIT> move in competition for business for staff and even for premises would soar sources said ruling Liberal Democratic Party has drawn up the guidelines of an economic package including a supplementary budget of more than 5000 billion yen a senior party official said The official the LDP Policy Affairs Research Council's Chairman Masayoshi Ito told a press conference the proposed supplementary budget will probably be compiled no earlier than August but before November It also urges the government to concentrate in the first half of the current fiscal year which began on April 1 a record proportion of the year's public works spending The guidelines will be explained to the US this week when Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa visits Washington for the meetings with the IMF and G-7 ministers Ito added The LDP suggested the government review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment in public works projects presented by individual ministries Ito said But the LDP official said the government should not abandon its fiscal reform target of ending the issue of deficit-covering bonds by fiscal 1990 These measures should be treated as an emergency partly because of the urgent need for Japan to redress its external trade imbalance with the US He said The guideline will be the basis for a more detailed reflationary plan to be worked out by the LDP before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29 for talks with President Reagan Ito said The full government-endorsed economic package is expected to be announced in late May The LDP expects public works spending in the first 1987/88 half to account for more than 80 pct of what was originally incorporated in the fiscal 1987 budget Ito said The previous record for the rate was 775 pct in 1986/87 Ito said revenue sources for the additional pump-priming measures should include the issue of construction bonds and the use of part of the proceeds from sales of the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp stocks An LDP statement said the government should use the additional budget mainly to encourage housing construction and to revitalize regional economies hit hard by the yen's rise corporate affairs minister Michael Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the UK Firm Cable and Wireless Plc's <CAWLL> shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries I put it to the (post and telecommunications) minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world Howard told reporters He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home he added British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue Howard said Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations Howard said We simply aren't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard's meeting with their minister But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute including Cable and Wireless to be satisfied Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations he added but gave no details He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with But of course we've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time he added What I've made plain is we expect to see action Howard ruled out using powers in Britain's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices Those powers which allow London to ban foreign financial firms like banks from Britain are designed to ensure UK Firms equal access to overseas financial markets Treasury Secretary James Baker holds talks with counterparts from Europe and Japan today to urge them to carry out commitments in a recent accord to speed their economic growth Baker is also expected to outline proposals for making agreements to coordinate economic policies more binding The bilateral discussions foreshadow full-blown talks of the Group of Five industrial countries joined later by Italy and Canada to form the Group of Seven The five comprise finance ministers and central bankers of the United States Japan West Germany France and Britain The Treasury Secretary is expected to see Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson Baker and other finance ministers say they intend to reaffirm the Paris Agreement to buttress global economic growth reduce trade imbalances and stabilize currencies Monetary sources said a short communique to that effect is expected after the meeting ends These talks form part of this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank At the same time monetary sources say they expect Baker to put forward proposals originally outlined at the 1986 Tokyo Summit to tighten procedures for policy coordination Washington wants other major nations to establish specific policy goals for economic growth inflation current account balance of payments trade balances budget performance monetary conditions and currencies If actual economic performance veers sharply away from such objectives then countries should consult on whether corrective action is necessary the proposal says Monetary sources said there was some support for the proposal which may not be made final until the Venice Economic Summit in June but Britain and West Germany were firmly against any attempt to make corrective action automatic The US Treasury team led by Baker has worked on this plan since last September when it won the support of France Baker meanwhile will press Japan and West Germany to live up to their commitments made over six weeks ago in Paris to boost their domestic demand to absorb more imports He is also expected to reassure his counterparts that the Reagan administration will reach agreement with Congress on a significant budget deficit cut this year helping to depress US demand for imports The aim of the Paris Accord is to redress the huge imbalance between the trade surpluses of Tokyo and Bonn on the one hand and Washington's massive trade deficit on the other Japan in particular is under pressure to come up with a meaningful stimulus package or face a further rise in the yen Financial markets appear to believe the yen should go higher against the dollar a development that has become unacceptable in Japan The Paris Agreement by the United States Japan West Germany France Britain and Canada called for currencies to be stabilized around current levels But the dollar fell again just several weeks after the agreement was reached and its present stability is said to be temporary as dealers await the outcome of this week's talks Meanwhile representatives of the leading Third World countries continue preparing their position for their ministers to present to industrial nations later this week Monetary sources said the so-called Group of 24 developing nations are preparing a very tough communique which brands the western strategy for shoring up the debt strategy as a failure They call instead for vast new assistance from the industrial world and a much greater role for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank is in the process of arranging two co-financings for projects in the electrical sector director of public credit Mauricio Cabrera said He told journalists he expects an 866 mln dlr loan to be co-financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to be completed by the middle of next month He also said talks have just concluded with the World Bank on a 200 mln dlr co-financing and that discussions with the bankers will begin later this month Cabrera was here for the signing yesterday of a 50 mln dlr floating rate note The floating rate note was the first such issue for Colombia which has had limited access to the international capital markets since the eruption of the international debt crisis in 1982 despite its ability to avoid a rescheduling The IADB co-financing is for Interconexion Electrica SA (ISA) a public electricity utility The loan is for 10 years with four years grace Interest will be at 1-1/8 pct during the grace period after which the margin will rise to 1-1/4 pct Cabrera said There is also a front end fee of one pct The cost of the project totals 3016 mln dlrs of which ISA will contribute about 100 mln and the IADB 115 mln he added Fuji Bank Ltd and Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd are arranging the commercial bank portion of the financing Cabrera noted that only about 20 pct of the loan will be drawn this year He said the World Bank co-financing is likely to come to the market no earlier than June It is part of an overall financing for various projects in the electrical sector that will take four years and cost about 300 mln dlrs a year Of the total cost he expects the World Bank and the IADB to contribute about 700 mln dlrs with the Export-Import Bank of Japan lending between 200 and 300 mln The balance will come from commercial banks Cabrera said that Colombia also plans one other issue in the international capital markets this year The country expected to launch up to 120 mln dlrs in floating rate notes but the market has virtually disappeared in the past few months as supply outstripped demand and the number of market makers contracted sharply Cabrera said he is now considering several options including a fixed rate Eurobond and an issue in Japan Last year Colombia arranged a private placement in Japan for the equivalent of about 40 mln dlrs Although it prefers a public issue Colombia would place any financing in Japan privately Bankers noted that the floating rate note signed yesterday which was for seven years with four years grace and paid 1-1/8 pct over Libor was basically a disguised loan Cabrera said that as of December 31 1986 Colombia had 11 billion dlrs of public sector foreign debt and 34 billion dlrs of private sector debt Of its planned total borrowings this year of two billion dlrs he said that about 14 billion had been arranged before the end of 1986 and that most of the borrowings in 1987 will be drawn in future years United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to enforce world trade rules The call by US Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade Today's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September The round which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate Smith called for boosting GATT's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy Smith said Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies Smith who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community (EC) officials told the committee wanted to stress GATT's importance and did not discuss specifics We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvementWhether in formal or informal meetings he said GATT's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the US-Japanese accord on semiconductors The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement President Reagan who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to US Exports week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international monetary system and related issues the Italian Treasury said It said in a statement the G-7 meeting which Italy plans to attend will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year On February 22 Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its G-7 partners - the United States Japan West Germany France Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier session of talks involving G-5 members Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said- Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever the management or the improvement of the international monetary economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with' Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the grounds that G-5 grouping the United States Japan West Germany France and Britain had reduced Italy's role to rubber stamping agreements already taken The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was certain that this time incidents would not occur But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5 is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in US tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17 industry analysts said The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks the analysts said Prices have gone up for memory components the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run Others however were more optimistic saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs We've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching Kurlack added Industry analysts said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry or MITI had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year's semiconductor accord with the US The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the US market But some analysts said Japan's attempt to mollify the US was a double edged sword and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the US As production in Japan is cut these analysts argue prices will rise in the US and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips US computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington but at the same time they're demonstating their muscle analyst Peck said The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit US chip makers I think this could be a very important factor for US semiconductor manufacturers industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said But analyst Peck said it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment industrial nations will be reviewing the Paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalances but the US thinks the accord has been successful so far a senior US Treasury official said The Paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting It has been successful and continues to be succesfull a senior US Treasury official told reporters In a briefing ahead of this week's semiannual IMF and World Bank meetings he also said the US was looking to West Germany and Japan to bolster their economic growth The official said both surplus countries like West Germany and Japan and deficit countries like the US agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth He reaffirmed the US would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit resist protectionism and boost US competitiveness The official also said that he expected trade issues like the dispute between the US and Japan over microchips to be included in the discussions The official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Seven discussions He said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts The official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals Asked whether the US was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators the official said the issue would be reported to the Venice Summit in June Monetary sources said the US proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy coordination agreements like the Paris Accord more binding crushers bought 5000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for late May/early June shipment trade sources said will seek to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow Japanese officials said However the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February to be strengthened Currency target zones or reference ranges will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow the Japanese officials said The meeting which is being held in conjunction with this week's International Monetary Fund/World Bank sessions will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord the officials said Miyazawa met with US Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar/yen exchange rates officials said but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency but also for the benefit of the United States as well As to US urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7 the officials said However Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987/88 budget has not been authorized by the Diet or parliament despite the new fiscal year which started April one the officials said Japan's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5000 billion yen in additional spending Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly after the opening at around 14530 yen dealers said The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house sold dollars putting pressure on the US Currency they said The dollar was also supported by a major electrical consumer goods company which was a speculative dollar buyer at around 14525 yen they added The dollar opened at 14533 yen against 14560/70 in New York and 14525 at the close here yesterday rubber stocks fell to 44980 tonnes in March from 46198 in February and from 53784 in March 1986 the Japan Rubber Trade Association said The stocks (in tonnes) with February and year-earlier comparisons were - March 87 Feb 87 March 86 Crude Rubber 41536 42094 49551 Synthetic 3334 3978 4044 Latex 110 126 189 Mining Co Ltd said it lowered its selling price for electrolytic copper by 10000 yen per tonne to 260000 effective immediately ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has proposed expanding imports of 12 farm products named in a US Complaint against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year an LDP official said The products include fruit juices purees and pulp some tomato products peanuts prepared beef products and beans The proposal will be used as the basis for a more detailed LDP economic package to cut the trade surplus with the US The party is expected to formalise the package before April 19 when LDP General Council Chairman Shintaro Abe visits Washington of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves for Washington today with data he hopes will refute US Charges Japan has violated a pact on microchip trade A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the US Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun Kuroda said the US Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces The US Has excessive expectations To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time he said Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low US Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to forestall sanctions he will seek further talks with US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter US Officials said this week's talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs Corp will set up a 100 pct-owned subsidiary in Thailand to make microwave ovens and refrigerators for export to the US And western Europe a company spokesman said The company to be named <Sharp Appliances (Thailand) Ltd> will be capitalised at 21 billion yen and start operations in October he told Sharp hopes the subsidiary which will use parts from Japan and southeast Asia will eventually produce other electric appliances he said trade friction between the US And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage businessmen and officials said They told correspondents in Asian capitals a US Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the US And lead to curbs on American imports of their products But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain The US Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17 in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes We wouldn't be able to do business said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MCT> If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the US said Tom Murtha a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker <James Capel and Co> In Taiwan businessmen and officials are also worried We are aware of the seriousness of the US Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 156 billion dlrs last year 95 pct of it with the US The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs among the world's largest We must quickly open our markets remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of US Products if we want to defuse problems from possible US Retaliation said Paul Sheen chairman of textile exporters <Taiwan Safe Group> A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the US And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 71 billion dlrs with the US Up from 49 billion dlrs in 1985 In Malaysia trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the US In Hong Kong where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors some electronics manufacturers share that view But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further US Pressure to block imports That is a very short-term view said Lawrence Mills director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry If the whole purpose is to prevent imports one day it will be extended to other sources Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade he said The US Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the US And Japan with interest and concern Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter Button said He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant US Exports to that country Meanwhile US-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI) are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand ministry officials said MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln they said The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy the officials said They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources including oil nuclear coal and natural gas Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31 supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct) they noted Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> is negotiating the supply of car components to Mexican units of Ford Motor Co <F> and Chrysler Corp <C> a Nissan spokeswoman said <Nissan Mexicana SA de CV> is owned 964 pct by Nissan and 36 pct by Marubeni Corp <MARTT> It expects to win orders for precision casting parts for engines and aluminium cases for automatic transmissions These will supply output of 70000 mid-size cars a year at Chrysler's Mexican unit the spokeswoman said Nissan is negotiating a similar deal to supply Ford's Mexican unit with precision casting parts for car engines the spokeswoman said without providing further details The company is expected to reach agreements with both US Car makers sometime this year she said Nissan Mexicana will invest about 400 mln yen to improve production facilities after the agreements are signed she said Iwai Corp> and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <KAWHT> have jointly won an order to build 200 subway cars worth about 200 mln dlrs for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York a Nissho spokesman said The cars to be produced with 51 pct US Content will be delivered between early 1988 and August 1989 he said Ten will be built in Japan but the others will be made at a Yonkers New York plant equally owned by Nissho and Kawasaki Bank Ltd <SUMIT> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank financial analysts said Osaka-based Sumitomo with desposits of around 239 trillion yen merged with Heiwa Sogo a small struggling bank with an estimated 129 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans in October But despite the link-up Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position We'll be back in position in first place within three years Komatsu said in an interview He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive It has expanded overseas entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves They've made bold moves to put everything in place Now it's largely out of their hands said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter US Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman Sachs and Co Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 125 pct limited partnership in the bank but for the time being at least the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel or increase the business they do with each other The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected said one analyst But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time US Regulations will change in the near future and if so we can do various things We only have to wait two or three years not until the 21st century Komatsu said Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act Japan's version of the US Glass-Steagall Act separates commercial from investment banking But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities We need to find new business chances Komatsu said In some cases these will be securities related in some cases trust bank related That's the kind of deregulation we want Until such changes occur Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd in which it holds a five pct share Komatsu said He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary Banca del Gottardo The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of US Commercial banks soon following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary We don't want to make waves We expect this will be allowed in two or three years he said Like other city banks Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business he added The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies said Kleinwort's Smithson After that it's a question of absorbing and juggling around It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong Japanese automakers are gearing up to equip sporty models with four-wheel steering a feature that could become standard on high-grade cars in the future automotive industry sources said Two companies are ready to market such cars soon they said Honda Motor Co Ltd will sell its Prelude with four-wheel steering from this Friday and Mazda Motor Corp officials say a model with the new steering will be out by mid-year Mazda aims to ship the cars overseas before year-end but the decision will depend on initial consumer reaction Nissan Motor Co Ltd has offered a less sophisticated four-wheel steering system on its Skyline since August 1985 Toyota Motor Corp has exhibited its developments in the field at a recent motor show and Mitsubishi Motors Corp said it will use the system in the near future Though major US And European automakers have also researched and tested the four-wheel system they say they are waiting to see consumer response to the Japanese cars and for further improvements in safety and costs Four-wheel steering allows drivers to easily manoeuvre into parking spaces and gives more control on sharp turns Mazda officials believe the new steering will improve safety At extremes four-wheel steering gives a driver more control said one official On slippery surfaces or at high speeds the system reduces unnecessary movement of the vehicle While acknowledging the added vehicle stability a Honda engineer said: This invention is not intended to improve safety but is aimed at allowing everyone to drive easily Mazda's electronic steering system tells the back wheels to turn in the opposite direction from the front wheels at slow speeds but in the same direction at high speeds Honda's system which is mechanical is similar but the direction of the rear wheels is determined by the angle of the front wheels With Nissan's system the rear wheels move only parallel to the front Automakers say professional drivers who have tested the four-wheel steering say it greatly improves handling An official with one US Vehicle manufacturer said four-wheel steering is a technical improvement but it is uncertain whether it will translate into higher sales or profits All automakers are interested in something new he said If it becomes a predominant factor everyone will want to follow The official said four-wheel steering is partly a gimmick to sell cars It's a benefit of a secondary nature compared with devices for fuel economy or emission control General Motors Corp has developed a four-wheel steering system but is unlikely to market it within the next five years Y Hojoh engineer with the Japan branch of General Motors Overseas Corp said GM must consider the costs to the consumer he added The industry sources said the additional cost of the system in Japan would probably make little difference to the consumer as it would be added to already high-priced models Agriculture Ministry angered by US Demands that Japan open its farm products market will tell US Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing US Farm exports to Japan a senior ministry official said Imports from the US Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers the official who declined to be named said Japan is the largest customer for US Farm products and it is not reasonable for the US To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market he said Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the US Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the US He said End-users would also buy other origins grain traders said US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27 has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to US Suppliers and remove quotas on US Beef and citrus imports Other countries are already cutting into the US Market share here Australia the largest beef supplier to Japan has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31 Imports of US Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although the US Will remain the largest supplier US Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports mainly from the US Japanese officials said An indication of the US Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to US Agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business The US Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products including fruit juices purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce peanuts prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans To help calm heated trade relations with the US Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector Japan is the largest buyer of US Farm products and these issues should not be discussed on the same table the official said economic package unveiled yesterday by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) marks the start of a major shift away from the policies of the past private economists and government officials said A big step forward has been taken said Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi The package seen as a response to mounting overseas pressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy calls for a supplementary budget of more than 5000 billion yen later this year plus increased imports Although the measures must still gain the approval of the Finance Ministry economists said the government will find it too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they have gained domestic and overseas backing At last the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning a corner said Sumitomo Bank Ltd's chief economist Masahiko Koido For the past five years the government has adhered to a tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit financing bonds in 1990 To meet that goal spending departments are required to submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the previous year and investment five pct below Masayoshi Ito chairman of the LDP's policy affairs council said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990 fiscal reform target but should review the ceiling it places on public works spending Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledge that policy changes might be needed including easing the government's iron grip on spending Economists said the government could meet its 1990 target and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by taking advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt Officially the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tight stance but some signs of change have appeared We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to restore fiscal balance a Finance Ministry spokesman said He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals simultaneously These were reforming the government's fiscal position and stimulating domestic demand But the Finance Ministry spokesman added In looking at the current situation of the economy and the relationship between Japan and the United States we feel we have to place more emphasis on stimulating demand Economists predict battles within the government over the coming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of fiscal discipline The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in the dike it will lead to a flood Industrial Bank's Taketomi said But Taketomi said the ministry provided it has a device in place to check excess spending for political reasons is likely to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy This seems to mark the first step toward a more active fiscal policy in response to requests from the international community he said Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implements the LDP's 5000 billion yen package economic growth in the 1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct His current forecast of 22 pct growth assumes a supplementary budget of around 1000 billion yen and Britain have signed a memorandum on exchange of securities market information to protect investors and promote the integrity of securities markets Finance Ministry officials said As interaction between Japanese and UK Securities markets grows it is desirable for both countries to exchange supervisory and investigatory information to assist each other in securing compliance with their statutes rules and requirements the memorandum said The ministry's securities bureau has a similar arrangement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission top US Official said Japan has little chance of convincing the US To drop threatened trade sanctions despite the efforts of a Japanese team that left for Washington today Michael Armacost Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs was asked at a press conference whether Japan's moves to boost its domestic economy and open its markets could persuade the US Not to impose tariffs on Japanese imports said and replied: It is probably too early for the figures to demonstrate that the situation has turned around and to permit the result you have described Armacost said the US Hopes Japan will take steps to lift its domestic economy and reduce dependence on exports remove barriers to imports and settle outstanding trade issues There are obvious problems at the moment in the trade area but we do not wish those problems to divert attention from important areas of cooperation that continue to exist on security and political issues he said The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation he said zinc ingot exports fell to 882 tonnes in March from 1764 in February and 3008 in March 1986 the Mineral Resources Department said A spokesman for Padaeng Industry Co Ltd the country's sole exporter attributed the decline to the company's lower stocks which averaged 5000 tonnes in the first quarter against 16000 tonnes in late 1985 when it began exporting The department said major buyers included China Japan the Philippines South Korea Singapore and Taiwan Thailand exported 4842 tonnes of zinc ingots during the first quarter down from 14937 a year ago zinc ingot exports fell to 882

with France on April 17 in Tokyo the second such meeting after a first session in May last year The agenda has not yet been decided The Japanese side will be headed by Toyoo Gyohten Vice Finance Minister for International Affairs while the French delegation will include Daniel Lebegue Director General of the Treasury markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets analysts said High short-term interest rates a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months largely from Japanese and US Investors analysts polled by said Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile US Dollar instruments they said A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 071 US Dlrs all illustrated the inflow Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said There is a 'flight to quality' Hamley said Australia may not be in the best (economic) position but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the US Unit analysts said We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the US Where some people would be concerned about the value of the US Dollar Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable? But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy he said It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy Buttrose said adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14 While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates analysts said It will remain very edgy money If something was not to be delivered if the statement wasn't considered tough enough one might see a substantial outflow Buttrose said Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit analysts said They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here Buttrose said Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their eyes off the yen because of the crucial role of Japanese investors Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen Apart from its recovery against a weak US Dollar the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market It has followed Wall Street and other markets but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities particularly in the gold sector The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 17583 today nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986 while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 30810 in the same period The property sector is also sought after with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate particularly in the tourism field Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought They think they find good value real estate here which with long term and fixed capital investment is the kind of investment Australia needs Buttrose added Bank of Japan spokesman declined to comment on a press report that the central bank had decided to conduct closer scrutiny of the operations of financial institutions in the bond market The JIJI Press news agency had quoted Bank of Japan sources as telling Japanese reporters the bank was deeply concerned over potential risk in yen bond trading because the market had risen too fast However JIJI quoted the sources as saying the central bank would not take such actions as guiding interest rates higher JIJI quoted the sources as saying that current bond market yields are similar to short-term interest rates due to excessive speculative operations This was attributable to heavy redemptions of government bonds and unclear prospects for the dollar which has sent many foreign bond market participants to the domestic market the sources were quoted as saying Motor Ltd <ISUMT> will pay no dividend for the first half year ending April 30 1987 as the company is expected to mark a 12 billion yen parent company current loss in the first half due to slow exports caused by the yen's appreciation a company spokesman said The company has paid no dividend since the year ended October 31 1983 when it paid five yen It had a 444 billion yen current profit in the first half of 1985/86 of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Vice Minister Makoto Kuroda leaves for Washington today with data he hopes will refute US Charges Japan has violated a pact on microchip trade A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the US Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals I have nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current situation Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun Kuroda said the US Decision was based on incorrect data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market forces The US Has excessive expectations To stabilise supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time he said Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low US Chip sales in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to forestall sanctions he will seek further talks with US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter US Officials said this week's talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs Steel Corp <NSTCT> denied local newspaper reports that China has been seeking to buy steel plants from Japanese firms which plan to suspend output under the recently announced rationalisation program The Mainichi Shimbun quoted Nippon Steel as saying that China's State Planning Commission and some Chinese firms have asked Japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling mills to expand steelmaking cheaply It named no sources A Nippon Steel spokesman told that China has made no such official request and the company was not considering such sales at the moment But Mainichi quoted Nippon Steel officials as saying if prices are reasonable they would export their used mills to China The paper said China's crude steel output totalled 52 mln tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln by 1996 Japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years top US Official said Japan has little chance of persuading the US to drop threatened trade sanctions despite the efforts of a Japanese team

he said The question is whether through cooperative actions between our governments we can reduce the (trade) imbalance or whether Congress takes action to reduce it through protectionist legislation he said Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars shortly after the opening at around 14530 yen dealers said The central bank intervened as a medium-sized trading house sold dollars putting pressure on the US Currency they said The dollar was also supported by a major electrical consumer goods company which was a speculative dollar buyer at around 14525 yen they added The dollar opened at 14533 yen against 14560/70 in New York and 14525 at the close here yesterday Philadelphia Stock Exchange will soon open offices in Hong Kong and Tokyo to help boost Far Eastern participation in foreign currency options before it starts evening trading in four or five months time exchange president Nicholas Giordano told reporters Japanese institutions are already major players in foreign currency options traded in Philadelphia using subsidiaries or agents to trade during the current daytime session should promote division of labour with its Asian neighbours especially the newly industrialized countries to help achieve more balanced world economic growth the Bank of Japan said in a report Instead of trying to produce everything by itself Japan should open up its market further to imports transfer manufacturing facilities abroad and increase technology transfer with those nations the bank said in its monthly report Japan should not see industrializing Asian nations as mere competitors in its overseas and domestic markets but as countries that can contribute to the region's prosperity The bank said trade relations between Japan and the Asian neighbouring countries have so far been vertical meaning that Japan imports primary goods from those countries and exports manufactured goods to them But this has resulted in an increase in their trade deficits with Japan while some newly industrialized Asian nations have accumulated trade surpluses with countries like the United States and Japan clashed today over UK Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as trade tensions between the two countries mounted British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard told reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response to Britain's non-negotiable timetable for increased British membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE) head Michio Takeuchi in which he demanded greater exchange access as very frank indeed In a separate press conference TSE President Michio Takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise its membership and called on Britain to make some concessions According to Takeuchi Howard wants three British firms to be named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of this year Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies Next May is the earliest possible date for opening our membership and I want the British government to understand this Takeuchi said Membership cannot be increased before space on the trading floor is expanded in May 1988 he said Howard told reporters that was not good enough and said that Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financial institutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from the two countries in May or June to come up with a postive response to the British timetable or face retaliation he said The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very reasonable request and I expect it to be met he said Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floor space to expand membership Howard replied We find it very difficult in our country to understand why the considerable ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in world markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind While here Howard said he also expressed frustration with the huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handling of demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater role in Japan's telecommunications business According to Japanese newspaper reports at least some of that message may have penetrated According to several reports the Post and Telecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wireless proposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the US Ministry officials were unavailable for comment ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has proposed expanding imports of 12 farm products named in a US Complaint against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year an LDP official said The products include fruit juices purees and pulp some tomato products peanuts prepared beef products and beans The proposal will be used as the basis for a more detailed LDP economic package to cut the trade surplus with the US The party is expected to formalise the package before April 19 when LDP General Council Chairman Shintaro Abe visits Washington Paperboard Co Inc said it has entered into an agreement with Ozaki Trading Co Ltd of Osaka Japan

contributary cause to a Japan Air Lines Co Ltd <JAPNY> 747 crash on August 12 1985 that killed 520 people the final draft of a Ministry of Transport report says There were only four survivors when the aircraft crashed into a mountain north of Tokyo The report said inadequate inspection of the aircraft by Japanese inspectors after the repairs was another factor in the crash The crew were cleared of any responsibility for the disaster The report which was sent on March 23 to the US National Transportation Safety Board for comment should be released in late May Under an international convention the draft must be submitted for final comments to the relevant authorities Boeing spokesmen were unavailable for comment On April 4 a Boeing spokesman at the firm's headquarters said the company would probably make no comment on the Japanese investigation team's report until it was officially released On September 6 1985 Boeing said in a statement that the 1978 repairs it had undertaken were faulty This statement did not however connect the faulty repairs with the cause of the crash intends to negotiate further agreements on international securities regulation to match those now in force with the US And Japan government sources said The Department of Trade and Industry said earlier it had concluded a memorandum of understanding with Japan's Finance Ministry to swap supervisory and investigatory information The agreement covers stocks shares and government bonds but not commodity futures whose regulation in Japan does not come under the Finance Ministry It therefore does not cover some transactions on the London International Financial Futures Exchange and the London commodities and metal exchanges The DTI said it hoped to seek further understandings with other countries which met in the UK Last December The meeting involved delegates from the UK Switzerland the US Canada Australia Hong Kong Japan France West Germany and Holland Government sources said the deal with Japan completes arrangements linking Tokyo the US And London A UK Agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was signed last September Today's agreement will deal with requests for

first US-manufactured digital central office switching systems to be installed in the Japanese public telephone network it said Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high US tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports Makoto Kuroda vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith and the Under Secretary of Commerce Bruce Smart The new tariffs to go into effect on April 17 are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to US semiconductor shipments They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors including television and audio equipment and computers Both US and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 US-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced US officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement In making the annoucement Reagan said I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices which are said to have injured the US semiconductor industry as Congress which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing US trade deficit which last year reached 1698 billion dlrs About one-third of the deficit was with Japan Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders The United States has excessive expectations he said To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time He also said that US firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said US trade sanctions against Japan were likely take effect on April 17 in spite of a full court press by Japanese officials to avoid them All indications are they will take effect he said I would say Japan is applying the full court press  They certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position Fitzwater told reporters He noted high level meetings on the trade dispute are underway here but said I don't think there's anything I can report and I don't believe there's been any official movement Industries Inc said it and Sango Co Ltd of Japan have started building a new 119000 square foot joint venture auto exhaust plant in Madison Wis The company said the 152 mln dlr plant of its Arvin Sango Inc venture with Sango is scheduled to be in

said De Zeeuw expressed concern over protectionism and high farm price supports House lawmakers noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan rates committee staff said Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (US) loan rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally one source said De Zeeuw was told of the US lawmakers' frustration with Japan's restrictive rice import policy and members defended the US dairy policy which aims to cut surplus production by subsidizing producers to trim herds sources said Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture members

Lyng De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week His trip to North America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in the key GATT member states The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting in February and is expected to meet again in May White House said high US Tariffs on Japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as scheduled on April 17 despite an all-out effort by Japan to avoid them Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the remark one day before US And Japanese officials are to meet under the emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to discuss trade and the punitive tariffs Fitzwater said: I would say Japan is applying the full-court pressThey certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position But he added that all indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect Information Systems Inc a unit of <Siemens AG> of West Germany has reached an agreement in principle with NEC America Inc a unit of NEC

recombinant gene technology for the treatment of pancreatic cancer It has been tested in humans in Europe and the US since 1982 Centocor said it intends to begin clinical trials in the US this year with a modified form of the drug Under the agreement Ajinomoto will conduct clinical tests of the drug in Japan and both companies will jointly file for marketing approval for the product in Japan analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the US trade deficit or buoy the economy The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs Similarly the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year In terms of the economy 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit said Stanley Collander a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst At best it will have a small positive effect Collander said in an interview Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar The US government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger Such a decline he has said could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit In addition in February US officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels As part of that agreement Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit Volcker said recently is to reduce US consumption particularly federal spending If you don't deal with the budget deficit everything else you do is going to be counterproductive Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy then the answer is it's not enough Silvia told The US trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems The 1986 deficit was 1698 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end In the past Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget On the other hand he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs For political reasons 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get out of Congress at the present time said Touche Ross's Collander To do something more than that would be extraordinary remarkable and very very difficult Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels To an extent this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level he explained Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 185 billion dlrs in new taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts Agriculture Ministry declined comment on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks on its closed rice market in the new GATT round We have no idea about the report and cannot comment a spokesman told Nihon Keizai Shinbun quoting unnamed government sources said Japan would tell US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks The US Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the US At the GATT talks Japan will try to persuade the US That its rice policy is justified it said The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September It will take four years to negotiate Denko Ltd> said it is exporting aluminium billet casting equipment and technology to countries that have recently begun aluminium smelting A company official said it won a 500 mln yen order to deliver 10 sets of casting equipment to Venezuela's Venalum by end-1987 He said it received an order for one set from Aluminium Bahrain BSC Last year and expects further orders from the Bahrain smelter Showa Denko withdrew from smelting last year but expects to increase its sales of equipment and technology he said little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with political analysts said MPT thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the US And Britain is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians they said The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector telecommunications and information said one diplomatic source They are a potent political force the diplomatic source said But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy analysts said The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd which now monopolizes the business It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists The ministry's stance has outraged both London which has threatened to retaliate and Washington which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for US Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place said James Abegglen head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority analysts said With the legal framework eased they became the de facto legal framework said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence the analysts said Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s) but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and  Recognized the importance of MPT Uchida said Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group he added The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System analysts said MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits a key element in financial liberalisation since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks they said Diplomatic sources frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture have characterized the ministry as feudal Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations they said But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain several analysts said The United States is really the odd man out Abegglen said For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view he said of prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections His presence will do more harm than good an LDP candidate in Tokyo told The candidate is one of several conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10 if the LDP lost too many major local seats Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his party to its greatest-ever election victory last July and analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline Over 2500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of polling The first round is on Sunday the second on April 26 Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the governorship of Fukuoka southern Japan The LDP and two centre parties are challenging the incumbent governor Hachiji Okuda who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist parties The proposed tax is a key campaign issue The LDP and the centrist parties should have about 1350000 votes against 700000 for Okuda But Okuda is the incumbent and has the sales tax weapon said Rei Shiratori professor of political science at Dokkyo University Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if the LDP wins in Fukuoka he said Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido But Kenzo Uchida professor of political science at Hosei University said Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if the LDP loses only in Hokkaido The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales tax proposal The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system which has remained unchanged for 36 years It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese domestic demand and cut back on exports Without the tax revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating the economy is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the US Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday 1 The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting 2 The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement They agreed however that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services 3 The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of

1200 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today leaders of two of Japan's top business groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7) accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the yen's current level as appropriate Eishiro Saito chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said the yen's present rate is well above adequate levels He did not elaborate Takashi Ishihara chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development said the accord will not prevent the yen from rising further We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord Ishihara said G-7 members Britain Canada France Italy Japan the US And West Germany said in a statement they consider their currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange rates are stabilised at appropriate levels Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) will list yen bond futures contracts once the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission gives its approval which could come within six months CBOT chairman Karsten Mahlmann said Mahlmann earlier told a press conference he would visit Kyoji Kitamura director-general of the Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau to express the CBOT's concern that Japanese financial institutions and individuals are not permitted to trade on the CBOT Mahlmann is on a two-week tour of Hong Kong Tokyo and Sydney Mahlmann urged Japan to boost Tokyo's status as a world financial center by promoting the internationalisation of its financial industry The Finance Ministry is expected to allow local banks securities houses and insurance companies to use overseas markets from this month bond market sources said but officials would only say the issue was under study Initially the ministry is likely to bar corporate and individual investors due to their relative inexperience and to limit trading to instruments like currency stock indexes time deposits and government debt futures the sources said Mahlmann told reporters the CBOT will start evening trading to coincide with Far East morning activity on April 30 But he added night sessions would not preclude the CBOT from forming links with Far Eastern exchanges although nothing had been decided Asked what type of financial futures would be appropriate he cited products concerning debt and equity The CBOT evening session will run from 6:00 to 9:00 PM Chicago time (2300 to 0200 GMT) which is 8:00 to 11:00 AM In Tokyo and trading will be limited to four contracts -- US Treasury note and bond futures and options he said Yen bond dealers said a proposed link between CBOT and the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) combined with yen bond futures listings on both would multiply volume if trade was encouraged by Tokyo-based orders Healthy liquidity growth in cash yen bond markets overseas is a prerequisite for expanded futures trading traders said LIFFE plans to list yen bond futures should go ahead from September possibly coinciding with the CBOT traders said The CBOT applied for permission to offer a long-term Japanese government bond futures contract on March 17 and the authorities must rule on the request within a year Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and US Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in Washington government officials said Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very seriously said an official travelling with him Britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions on Japanese finance houses in London if Japan does not open up its markets The US Has already imposed higher tariffs on computer microchips imported from Japan Michael Howard the British minister for consumer and corporate affairs repeated the threat of sanctions before leaving Tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during which he failed to secure major concessions from the Japanese Howe's main mission in Washington was to brief Shultz on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union last week Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week statement issued today by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialised nations has put Japan under greater international pressure to stimulate its economy or face a further rise in the yen private economists and analysts said They said the communique reflected increased foreign frustration with Japan's burgeoning trade surplus and its tight-fisted fiscal policies in the past Unless Japan implements economic measures included in the statement foreign protectionist sentiment would grow and the yen would come under renewed upward pressure they said The G-7 -- grouping the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada -- said in the statement they welcomed proposals announced by Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate its economy and that Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open its domestic markets It's rather unusual that only Japan was mentioned in the communique and promised something said Takeshi Saito general manager of Fuji Bank Ltd's research division This showed how strongly other nations want Japan to take concrete and effective steps to redress its trade surplus he said The statement referred to some details of Japan's proposed economic measures such as early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years and unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures It did not mention any figure for the projected supplementary budget but LDP officials have said it will amount to more than 5000 billion yen for fiscal 1987 which compares with 2000 billion provided for the previous year It signalled a clear shift away from the conservative fiscal policies of the past said Kazuaki Harada senior managing director of Sanwa Research Institute For the last five years the government has stuck to a tight-fisted fiscal policy in its attempt to stop issuing deficit financing bonds by 1990 But mounting foreign pressure for Japan to boost its economy hurt by the yen's extended rise hurried the government to hammer out a draft economic package and bring it to the latest G-7 meeting Harada said Japan should not view expansion of its economy as the result of pressure but as an opportunity to lead world economic growth The Japanese economy has the potential to take a leadership role and we should recognize it Harada said If Japan fails to meet such international expectations it will invite some retaliatory moves especially from the US Which may result in a further rise of the yen analysts said The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a more balanced world trade structure they said has asked Japan for a 42 billion yen 25-year loan to finance the construction of gas pipelines from eastern Trengganu to southern Johor the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) said OECF's chief representative Takashi Matsuya told reporters the Japanese Government is appraising the loan Another OECF official told Japan is likely to approve the loan because it is technically and economically viable If approved the loan would carry a coupon rate of four pct a grace period of seven years Matsuya said It would be disbursed over three years he added The pipeline contruction is the second phase of the Peninsular Gas Utilisation Project by Petronas Malaysia's national oil company The first phase was the supply of gas to households in and around the eastern oil town of Kertih Japan Development Bank is issuing a 150 mln dlr eurobond due May 20 1994 paying eight pct and priced at 101-1/8 pct lead manager Bank of Tokyo International Ltd said The non-callable bond is guaranteed by Japan and is available in denominations of 5000 dlrs The selling concession is 1-1/4 pct while management and underwriting combined pays 5/8 pct The payment date is May 20 Listing will be in London Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars at around 14510 yen just after the market here opened dealers said Just before the opening the dollar dropped swiftly as speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique issued in Washington contained nothing basically new they said It fell about a half yen to around 145 The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current levels reflect economic fundamentals One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in Australia before the opening here but could not confirm this Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar that has occurred since the Paris Agreement was within the range agreed on in the Louvre discussions I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris Miyazawa told a press conference following the Group of Seven meeting here He added that the current discussions were a reaffirmation of that agreement indicating that the solidarity that occurred in Paris was still in place coupon on the 100 mln dlr 15-year convertible eurobond for the Bank of Tokyo Ltd has been cut to 1-3/4 pct from the two pct initially indicated lead manager Bank of Tokyo International Ltd said The foreign exchange rate has been set at 14640 yen to the dollar but details of the conversion price were not immediately available which has been accused of dumping everything from steel to computer microchips on world markets is now under attack for alleged cut-throat selling of a product of a different sort -- banking services At meetings here this week Bank of England officials pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair advantage in world financial markets The technical banking talks coincided with but were separate from discussions between Japanese officials and British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard who left Tokyo yesterday for South Korea At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must put up to back up their loans It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what else should be included Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can undercut them on loans and other banking services because Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage Paul Hofer head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan told Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said They see us as very aggressive We say we are just trying to catch up with them Earlier this year the United States and Britain agreed to adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital equivalent to at least six pct of total assets The two countries urged others to follow suit notably Japan But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new regulations governing capital ratios last May Under those regulations banks have until 1990 to attain a capital ratio of four pct But in tacit recognition of overseas pressure the ministry set a six pct target for Japanese banks with overseas branches But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital Without the shares big Japanese banks would only have capital ratios of around three pct With them their ratios are well above six pct especially after the recent record-breaking climb of Tokyo share prices Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too high by the ministry Japanese banks would never be able to realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell the shares to raise funds in an emergency they say Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level But the US Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of their hidden reserves The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks on the subject Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and US Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in Washington government officials said Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very seriously said an

Union last week Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the US The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market up from 60 pct in 1984 The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified The Commission claims last year's accord between the US And Japan on microchip pricing gives US Firms privileged access to the Japanese market ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the US Treasury that ended last night the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a good meeting and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly The communique said The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting They agreed however that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed extraordinary and urgent measures including an unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels In the weeks that followed the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate It said the officials reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within

welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed he said He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen while other currencies especially the mark had remained stable Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement) the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea he said The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury he said It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level which could have an adverse impact on the market Miyazawa said Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement Miyazawa also said the US sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by US Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago yen is likely to start another uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new currency and bond analysts here said Is that it? I was expecting something more than that said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again The dollar hovered between 14550 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington After more than four hours of talks the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels The dollar sank to 14475 yen in early Tokyo trading They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154 Now they are saying it's in line when it's at 146 Will this still be so at 138 or 130? asked Republic's Cohen Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities' permissible range Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would probably be uneven They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars The dollar rebounded to about 14520 yen The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February US Trade data The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs from a provisional 148 billion in January leaders of two of Japan's top business groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7) accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to

analysts said The G-7 communique represented a test for Japan's commitment to domestically-generated economic growth and to a more balanced world trade structure they said United States which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies Monetary sources said they believed that US Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar the level at the February 22 Paris Accord to about 145 today The supplementary budget worth about 3448 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality The Group of Seven -- the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall While relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings West Germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place No mention was made however of the US commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record US trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates Monetary sources said that privately West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the US unit Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets The ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said good progress was made Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations The United States and France backed by the International Monetary Fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried monetary sources say because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the strengthening of the yen against the dollar since the Paris Agreement was within the range agreed in the Louvre discussions I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris Miyazawa told a press conference following the Group of Seven meeting here He said the current discussions were a reaffirmation of that agreement saying the solidarity that occurred in Paris was still in place Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve At a news conference after yesterday's G-7 meeting Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed he said He said this test of the G-7 nations' resolve had concentrated on the yen while other currencies especially the mark had remained stable corp said it has formed a new Tokyo-based subsidiary called Ropak Nippon Ltd to market its North American products in Japan It said the new unit has started importing plastic pans and other products for the packaging of seafood and will also market rigid-plastic shipping pails for a variety of packaging uses leaders of two of Japan's top business groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7) accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the yen's current level as appropriate Eishiro Saito chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren) said the yen's present rate is well above adequate levels He did not elaborate Takashi Ishihara chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development said the accord will not prevent the yen from rising further We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord Ishihara said United States which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies Monetary sources said they believed that US Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar the level at the February 22 Paris Accord to about 145 today And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan Kiichi Miyazawa Japan's Finance Minister said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris Miyazawa said yesterday The supplementary budget worth about 3448 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality The Group of Seven -- the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall While relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings West Germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place No mention was made however of the US commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record US trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman

selling of a product of a different sort -- banking services At meetings here this week Bank of England officials pressed their Japanese counterparts to change regulations that foreign bankers say give their Japanese rivals an unfair advantage in world financial markets The technical banking talks coincided with but were separate from discussions between Japanese officials and British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard who left Tokyo yesterday for South Korea At the crux of the talks was the way regulators in various countries measure bank capital and how much capital banks must put up to back up their loans It is generally agreed that shareholders' equity forms the bulwark of bank capital but there is disagreement about what else should be included Some foreign bankers contend that their Japanese rivals can undercut them on loans and other banking services because Tokyo's capital regulations are easier to meet The Japanese banks have an unfair advantage Paul Hofer head of the Foreign Bankers Association of Japan told Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido said They see us as very aggressive We say we are just trying to catch up with them Earlier this year the United States and Britain agreed to adopt common regulations requiring banks to put up capital equivalent to at least six pct of total assets The two countries urged others to follow suit notably Japan But Japanese Finance Ministry officials held out little hope that would happen soon as they just introduced new regulations governing capital ratios last May Under those regulations banks have until 1990 to attain a capital ratio of four pct But in tacit recognition of overseas pressure the ministry set a six pct target for Japanese banks with overseas branches But foreign bankers say the rub was that it allowed Japan's banks to count 70 pct of the value of their massive holdings of Japanese shares - their so-called hidden reserves - as capital Without the shares big Japanese banks would only have capital ratios of around three pct With them their ratios are well above six pct especially after the recent record-breaking climb of Tokyo share prices Western diplomats argue that the shares are valued far too high by the ministry Japanese banks would never be able to realize anywhere near that amount if they were forced to sell the shares to raise funds in an emergency they say Finance Ministry officials defended their stance by saying that studies of the stock market over the last 30 years show that prices have rarely fallen below the 70 pct value level But the US Federal Reserve seems to think otherwise Japanese officials say the Fed has effectively held up applications for bank licenses by Japanese financial institutions by asking them for a very detailed accounting of their hidden reserves The officials say Japan recently raised the issue with the Fed through its embassy in Washington and is hoping for talks on the subject bought 5000 tonnes Canadian

met US negotiators in an emergency effort to try to head off new high American tariffs on Japanese semiconductor goods set to go into effect on April 17 The vice minister of Ministry of International Trade and Industry Makoto Kuroda flew in from Tokyo for the talks with Deputy US Trade Representative Michael Smith A second round of talks is set for tomorrow US officials have said Japan has failed to live up to its semiconductor agreement with the US and there was little that could be done now to avert the 300 mln dlrs in tariffs Corp <SNET> chairman Akio Morita played down the US-Japanese trade conflict saying that direct investment abroad was the most effective way to reduce Japan's trade surplus Morita was speaking at the official opening of a 100 million franc (164 million dollars) compact disc player factory in eastern France He said trade friction between the US And Japan over high-technology was a very complicated and delicate issue but that Sony intended to invest directly throughout the world Referring to the European Community's stance against turnkey plants he said: I know Brussels is not very favourable to these so-called new Japanese 'screwdriver factories' but in Sony's case our policy is quite different The Colmar plant Sony's third in France would eventually use local components and be a purely French factory he said Sony France SA was established in 1973 Its 1986 sales were two billion francs (327 mln dlrs) and the company says it expects sales of 27 billion francs (443 mln dlrs) in 1987 Sony's other two French plants in the south west of the country export over 80 per cent of their production Company officials say that production from Sony's European factories currently accounts for over 30 per cent of the group's European sales and they expect this to increase In 1986 over 20 per cent of Sony's eight billion dollar worldwide sales were made in Europe At the beginning of 1987 Sony employed about 1100 people in Europe The group plans to open a compact disc software factory in Austria this summer and an audio cassette plant in Italy next year of prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have shunned his support in their campaigns for upcoming local elections His presence will do more harm than good an LDP candidate in Tokyo told The candidate is one of several conservatives who have rebelled and joined the public outcry against Nakasone's proposal for a five pct sales tax Political analysts said Nakasone might have to step down before the Venice summit of industrial democracies on June 8-10 if the LDP lost too many major local seats Nakasone's popularity has dropped sharply since he led his party to its greatest-ever election victory last July and analysts said the proposed tax was one reason for the decline Over 2500 local seats will be filled during two rounds of polling The first round is on Sunday the second on April 26 Political analysts said a seat to watch would be the governorship of Fukuoka southern Japan The LDP and two centre parties are challenging the incumbent governor Hachiji Okuda who is supported by the opposition socialist and communist parties The proposed tax is a key campaign issue The LDP and the centrist parties should have about 1350000 votes against 700000 for Okuda But Okuda is the incumbent and has the sales tax weapon said Rei Shiratori professor of political science at Dokkyo University Nakasone will serve out his term to the end of October if the LDP wins in Fukuoka he said Analysts believe the opposition is likely to win the governorship of the northern island of Hokkaido But Kenzo Uchida professor of political science at Hosei University said Nakasone can afford to get fairly tough if the LDP loses only in Hokkaido The opposition parties are campaigning to scrap the sales tax proposal The tax is one of the main pillars of Nakasone's plan to overhaul the tax system which has remained unchanged for 36 years It is also a key element in plans to boost Japanese domestic demand and cut back on exports Without the tax revenue the government would have less to spend on stimulating the economy Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage the prospects for growth and adjustment and called for cooperation in exchange markets In a statement to the International Monetary Funds Interim Committee Miyazawa said it was imperative that current account surplus countries follow policies designed to strengthen domestic demand and reduce surpluses while maintaining price stability He said Japan intended to carry out policies announced at the Paris meeting of finance ministers to stimulate its economy Miyazawa said that given the massive external imbalances and serious unemployment in some countries there are very real fears of a protectionist uprising In addition we are most concerned about this very serious problem of exchange rate instability Miyazawa

reporters that there was no pressure on Japan during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower its discount rate They added that they themselves do not feel any need for a cut at all Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters earlier today that some countries - those with strong currencies - might have to cut interest rates The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to call the G-7 pact a failure The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo which was sparked by remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the dollar's fall had been orderly They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since the Plaza agreement in September 1985 over a long-time span not the currency's recent movements They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or the other The Bank of Japan sources said the US Is putting more weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market stability than on other currencies Throughout the G-7 meeting Japan pointed to the dangers that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the US Hurting the US And world economies they said In February and in March of this year Japanese investors reduced their purchases of US Treasury bonds the sources said Each country in the G-7 - Britain Canada France Italy Japan the US And West Germany - has a different view about currency stability the Bank of Japan sources said This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a triangle of dollar/yen European currencies/yen and dollar/European currencies At the time of the Louvre agreement European countries did not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did not object to the yen strengthening they said Corp <SUMTT> and <Nippon Sharyo Ltd> have won a joint order for 54 railway cars worth 6960 mln dlrs from California's Los Angeles County Transportation Commission a Nippon Sharyo spokesman said He told components totalling 20 pct of the value of the articulated light rail vehicles will be US-made and that delivery is due between early 1989 and early 1990 The cars will be used for a Long Beach to Los Angeles service due to start in May 1989 Agriculture Ministry estimates Japan's edible oil demand will rise 15 pct in calendar 1987 to 168 mln tonnes from 165 mln in 1986 Domestic consumption will rise to 166 mln tonnes in 1987 from 164 mln in 1986 while imports will rise to 77000 tonnes from 70000 and exports will be unchanged at 14000 Edible oil supplies will total 175 mln tonnes in 1987 against 173 mln last year including domestic output of 160 mln against 155 mln Domestic supplies will comprise 725000 of soybean oil (706000 in 1986) 638000 of rapeseed oil (609000) and 235000 of other origin oils (231000) warned the United States it may take retaliatory measures if the United States imposes its planned trade sanctions on April 17 a senior government official said Shinji Fukukawa Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry said in a statement Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week However Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington yesterday Last month President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July 1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the United States and to open its home market to American goods Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact and said Washington had not given any detailed explanation of why it planned to impose the tariffs judge ruled that questions of liability in the 1985 crash of a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 which killed 520 people near Tokyo will be decided in Seattle But he left open the possibility that monetary damages could be awarded in a Japanese court The ruling by King County Superior Court Judge Gary Rittle came in a hearing on lawsuits in which survivors of 77 of the victims are seeking millions of dollars in compensation Rittle said after the liability problems are settled he will examine the question of where damages will be decided Lawyers for both the airline and the Seattle-based Boeing Co (BAN> argued that the suits should be handled in a Japanese court saying it would be more costly and time-consuming to hear them in an American court But lawyers for the victims' survivors said the two companies were trying to evade the liability question and reduce the amount of compensation they may have to pay Court officials said the case was likely to go to trial here in eight to 10 months A draft report by a Japanese Transport Ministry investigation team said faulty repairs in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by ministry inspectors had contributed to the cause of the disaster The report obtained by this week is expected to be made public next month Boeing has said it will probably not comment on the report until it is officially released British minister said he had given the Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its internal markets and it was clearly understood Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were beginning to appreciate the need to be fair and open about access to their own markets At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition charges that his trip had been a failure because he had returned empty-handed I did what I set out to do I was sent to deliver a clear message to the Japanese government and I delivered it very clearly and it has been clearly understood Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in Britain It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing operating licences We can ban firms from certain countries from carrying out certain kinds of business while allowing them to carry out other kinds I hope we don't have to use these powers but I made it clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met we shall use them He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became involved in a tit-for-tat exchange adding that Japan gained more than anyone else from an open trading relationship I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this relationship is to continue it is very important for them to be fair and open about access to their own markets On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> which is trying to win a significant share of telecommunications contracts in Japan Howard said he had told the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case He said there were signs of movement on the case Cable and Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday he said Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan but would have to coordinate action with its European Community partners Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as it has threatened Electric Corp <MIETT> said it is nearing an agreement with Unisys Corp <UIS> of the US To supply central processing units for a medium-sized Unisys mainframe computer planned to succeed the System 80 A Mitsubishi Electric official declined to say how many processors would be involved but said there are no plans to market the new Unisys computer in Japan Inc <CANNT> and Intel Corp <INTC> of the US Agreed to the joint development production and import of very large scale integrated circuits a Canon spokesman said He told Intel will make the chips and Canon will import them for use in for use in photocopiers printers and facsimiles to be made and sold in Japan Canon which last week made a similar pact with National Semiconductor Corp <NSM> plans to raise its ratio of microchip imports this year to 28 pct from 24 pct last year to take advantage of the yen's rise and help quell mounting trade friction he said stockmarket index plunged sharply at the start of afternoon trade as investors took profits from last week's four straight record closes brokers said The market index fell 42748 points to 2278911 only 13 minutes after afternoon trading began at 13:30 local time Brokers said concern over weekend announcements of mounting trade tension with Europe and the US Sparked the heavy selloff The average had risen 63048 points in the last four trading sessions of last week Bank of Japan actively bought dollars here in early afternoon trade at around 14220 yen dealers said The central bank had placed buy orders at that level and prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses they said However the intervention failed to boost the US Currency significantly from the 14220 yen level they added The dollar was trading around its midday rate of 14230 yen It had opened here at 14185 yen Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused an electoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's local elections political analysts said The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships but failed to restore a governorship in Fukuoka it had placed much importance on winning In the prefectural assembly elections to fill 2670 seats the LDP has so far lost 92 of its previously held 1487 seats to the socialists and communists Full election results should be available later today Discussing the election results with reporters Nakasone said I wouldn't say the proposed five pct sales tax had no effect at all but there were other factors such as a low turnout and unusually cold weather The Home Affairs Ministry said the average turnout for the 13 gubernatorial elections was a record low 5978 pct while the prefectural assembly polls drew an average of 6666 pct also a record low Noboru Goto president of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry and a longtime friend of Nakasone told reporters the impact of the sales tax on the LDP's setback was obvious The government should take action (on the sales tax) in regard to the people's wishes Goto said Nakasone and other LDP leaders have already hinted at a delay in the implementation of the tax which had been scheduled for next January and a possible cut in the rate The most important thing now is to get parliamentary approval of the budget as soon as possible to arrest a rapid appreciation of the yen Nakasone said We must implement measures to prop up the economy Opposition parties said the elections were a referendum on the tax and they will continue to demand its retraction states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC However they said an all-out trade war may be far off as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the US Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17 The EC tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the US The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 213 billion dlrs in March up from 194 billion in February In 1986 Japanese exports to the EC totalled 3067 billion dlrs up 45 pct from 1985 while EC exports to Japan fell one pct to 1243 billion dlrs In Paris trade minister Michel Noir said France has decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application of French quality standards -- something EC states say often happens to their own exports entering Japan Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract However British officials in London have said that the government may have gone too far in implying that it would take immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened By contrast West Germany with the EC's most successful economy has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions preferring to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent years substituting general calls for action by Japan to open its market with specific demands for moves in key areas At present it is for instance pressuring Japan to end allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and spirits to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts for the building of a new international airport and to simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits but often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount They stress however that any action must be taken by the EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action One of the problems Britain could face if it were to withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam they point out Legislators called on Japan to open its financial markets to more foreign participation and boost its efforts to head off growing US Protectionism a Foreign Ministry spokesman said We have come to seek the opening of Japan's financial and banking markets Jake Garn ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee told Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone Japan's financial and banking market is very large and increasingly sophisticated but there is not yet true reciprocity between Japan and the United States in this market the ministry official quoted Garn as saying Nakasone replied that some problems exist over providing more seats on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for foreign firms one of the main steps urged by the US Delegation But I promise to make Tokyo's markets as open as those of New York he told Garn and three other legislators In separate talks with Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa the US Group also urged Japan to give US Financial institutions a bigger role in the underwriting of long-term Japanese government bonds a Finance Ministry spokesman said Electric Power Co Inc will issue a seven-year 20 billion Euroyen bond on April 22 a company spokesman said The straight bond to be priced at 101625 will carry a 475 pct coupon to yield 4445 pct Lead manager is Nomura International Inc Issue cost including fees will be 48 pct or 09 percentage point below the March issue rates for Japanese electric power company bonds These are normally between the rates on 10-year government bonds and private corporate bonds Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MCT> said it would launch the world's smallest and lightest personal-use plain paper copier (PPC) on the domestic market in early June It said the 69800 yen copier is 367 mm by 407 mm by 120 mm weighs six kilos and can copy pictures from television and VCR's with an optional adaptor The company plans to produce 2000 sets a month and will eventually export them it said without providing further details Total Japanese PPC output rose 12 pct to 560000 units in 1986 and is projected to rise to 610000 this year it said ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force the government to water down its controversial proposal for a five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating the economy private economists said The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push through its tax plan and without a compromise tax proposal the budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be passed soon they said Without the budget the government would also be hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate the economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in late February and in Washington last week they said Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early this month The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on the already faltering economy said Johsen Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was public discontent with the government's high-handed push for tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in the most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and Hokkaido where the shipbuilding and steel industries are suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise he said Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting date of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Masahiko Koido also said he favours watering down the proposed sales tax while suggesting the government boost public works spending by modifying its tight fiscal policies The local election results were a signal the economy now needs government action to take clear-cut fiscal measures he said adding that such moves would help the world economy as well as Japan's For the last five years or so the government has stuck to a tight fiscal policy in a bid to halt the issue of deficit financing bonds by fiscal 1990/91 economists said If the LDP election setback leads to a scaled down sales tax proposal the government would have to find other revenue sources to help finance the planned tax cuts and a package of measures to stimulate the economy the economists said Koido said the government could raise additional revenue by selling shares in public corporations such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp But it should issue additional bonds to ensure a more stable source of funds he said It may run counter to its avowed policy of balancing the budget but it can do so on a short-term basis he said Takahashi of Mitsubishi Research also agreed with the need for the government to float more bonds to raise funds needed for economic expansion He said additional government borrowing would place no burden on the capital market because it has amassed huge excess funds and government bond prices have risen to record levels lately The market is just waiting for more new government bond issues he said oil traders and refiners are considering whether to suspend further business with Texaco Inc <TX> which yesterday filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy code industry sources told Texaco the third biggest US Oil company said it filed to protect itself from creditors while it fights a legal battle with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over the purchase of Getty Petroleum Corp <GTY> in 1984 Many Japanese trading houses decided to stop dealing with Texaco several months ago as rumours it was about to file for bankruptcy spread through the market the sources said We haven't dealt with them for six months said one Japanese trader Some Japanese trading houses with offices in the US May ask for letters of credit if they decide to continue trading with Texaco oil sources said They said Texaco which said its bankrupcty protection measure will not affect the majority of its businesses may find industry reaction stronger than anticipated Texaco tried to buy substantial volumes of gasoline on the US Gulf on Friday but no one offered to them one trading house source said One US Major is reviewing its relationship with Texaco and an international oil trading company while continuing limited transactions with Texaco will send its lawyers to meet with the company tonight in New York oil sources said But one Japanese oil company which holds several joint venture oil exploration interests with Texaco said business would continue as usual pending the outcome of the dispute a company spokesman said European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures EC diplomats said They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body GATT unless there are adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties or quantitative limits on Japanese exports The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe in the wake of possible US Tariff moves In May the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods Meanwhile Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily registering a record 213 billion dlrs in March Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in deficit financing bills today through 51-day repurchase agreements maturing June 3 to help absorb a projected money market surplus money traders said The operation will raise the outstanding supply of the bills to a record 4800 billion yen The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities houses from money houses will be 38999 pct compared with the two-month commercial bill discount rate today of 38750 pct and the two-month certificate of deposit rate of 413/00 pct The traders estimated the surplus today at about 1800 billion yen They said it is mainly due to 1300 billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments and public entities and to excessive banking system cash holdings due to continuous large central bank dollar purchases Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's unpopular plan to introduce a sales tax caused an electoral setback for his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in Sunday's local elections political analysts said The LDP retained its 11 prefectural governorships but failed to restore a

the US If Washington imposes tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese electronic goods from April 17 Kyodo News Agency reported a high-ranking MITI official as saying Japan would end the chip pact if the US Implements the punitive tariffs Nothing new has been decided the official said As MITI said on Saturday Japan would only pursue its rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

government official said at the weekend Shinji Fukukawa Vice Minister of the International Trade and Industry Ministry said in a statement that Japan would consider measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on some Japanese exports as planned next week However Fukukawa said Japan was ready to continue trade talks with the United States despite its failure to convince America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of emergency talks which ended in Washington on Friday In March President Reagan announced the sanctions in retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honor a July 1986 pact to stop dumping computer microchips in markets outside the US and to open its home market to US goods Fukukawa said the US had not listened to Japan's explanation of its efforts to live up the pact He saod the US had not given detailed reasons of why it planned tariffs Bank of Japan actively bought dollars here in early afternoon trade at around 14220 yen dealers said The central bank had placed buy orders at that level and prevented the dollar from falling when it came under heavy selling pressure from investment trusts and trading houses they said However the intervention failed to boost the US Currency significantly from the 14220 yen level they added The dollar was trading around its midday rate of 14230 yen It had opened here at 14185 yen trade figures are seriously challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems Senior Japanese US And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data for if currencies are the key they ask why then are are US Exports to Japan shrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of world trade recession? US-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York The lower dollar ought to have made US Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan The officials most of them economists can offer no objective reason why they are not Worse how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower So worst of all what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation officials can only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective I don't know and I don't think anyone knows said Hugh Richardson acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo What I do know is that Community exporters are making a hell of an effort in this market If you make an effort there is money to be made in Japan he added But US Officials and businessmen are convinced low US Exports to Japan are Japan's fault They cite restrictive trade practices protected Japanese trade sectors such as agriculture and non-tariff barriers such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports Publicly Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as US Aggression In private they blame US Industry for being uncompetitive We see it that way but we don't like to seem arrogant said a senior official who declined to be named We like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito chairman of the Keidanren business group and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand Japan's markets and some foreigners agree The real issue is the inability of major sectors of American and European industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets Peter Huggler President of Interallianz Bank Zurich told a recent conference in Switzerland share prices are expected to weaken further for about a week following a sharp drop which at one time today saw the Nikkei Dow index down 57101 points in mid-afternoon trading brokers said They said uncertainty caused by disputes between Japan and its main trading partners will continue to deter investors from equities The market index which closed the day 29705 points down at 2291954 will probably end the present downturn at around 22300 points brokers predicted This is just a short-term correction and the market will probably end up at about 22300 in about a week's time said a broker at Nomura Securities Co He said that today's late recovery from afternoon lows showed that investors were still hunting bargains in anticipation of an upturn Brokers reiterated expectations of an imminent cut in Japan's 25 pct discount rate a factor seen to be diverting money from bank accounts into stocks and boosting the market Securities company bank and insurance issues likely to benefit from a rate cut were bought in late trading The Nomura broker said he expects the rate cut in May or June after Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's scheduled visit to Washington on April 29 Nakasone is expected to seek an end to Japanese-US Trade disputes which are hurting investor confidence Until we see some concerted effort by the Japanese to halt the yen's rise against the dollar and settle trade disputes the market will stay low said head of equities at Jardine Fleming Securities Co Mario Malt Malt said current talks between the countries were inflammatory and damaged stockmarket optimism Brokers also said that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has to show it still rules after Sunday's nationwide local elections showed dwindling support It raises doubts on whether the LDP can push through the reforms it planned for this year said one broker Top policy priorities this year are deregulation of financial activities stimulation of domestic demand to boost imports and removal of agricultural subsidies If these policies are abandoned or scaled down stockmarket investors will have few reasons to buy stocks brokers said officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies which they believe they strengthened in talks last week Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States Japan West Germany France Britain Italy and Canada Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying: I don't believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollar's latest rapid descent involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation leading to a renewed rise in interest rates But there were signs too that while policymakers feared the market uproar they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher US Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid descent That distaste stems in part from fears of recession Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the US trade deficit It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us if not (into) recession into slower growth he said Asked if higher US Interest rates would stabilize the dollar Balladur said: When a currency is maintained artificially high by artificially high interest rates it is not healthy And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession he said Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of life Balladur said there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies this is not a fixed rate system But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens US Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements Baker told the meetings Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar Baker Darman said was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism West Germany and Japan meanwhile agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement when the dollar stood higher The Paris accord said currencies (are) within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals given the policy commitments summarized in this statement Now they accept the dollar's lower level especially against the yen as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals last week's statement read Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the US Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit states of the European Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open its market to imports but as often made only minor moves Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the willingness or at least the ability of the Japanese government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC However they said an all-out trade war may be far off as EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the US Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17 The EC tariffs which would involve renouncing obligations entered into with the world trade body GATT would be designed to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of the US The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's trade deficit with Japan reached a record 213 billion dlrs in March up from 194 billion in February European Community (EC) has effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its market to imports before it decides on possible tough retaliatory trade measures EC diplomats said They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26 to review the state of trade relations between the two sides The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC pledges to the world trade body GATT unless there are adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing stiff increases in duties or quantitative limits on Japanese exports The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare proposals for possible retaliatory action They said the commission has powers to take some limited action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese exports of electrical photographic and other goods being diverted to Europe following of possible US Tariff moves In May the ministers are also likely to discuss how to prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc which obliges them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown steadily registering a record 213 billion dlrs in March crushers bought 3000 to 4000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed in export business overnight for last half May/first half June shipment trade sources said Stanley (Jersey) Ltd is issuing 45000 covered equity warrants exercisable into shares of Japan

start by October One and contribute significantly to profits ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) setback in Sunday's nationwide local elections may force the government to water down its controversial proposal for a five pct sales tax and undermine its commitment to stimulating the economy private economists said The LDP's failure to win seats in some crucial local constituencies will weaken the government's ability to push through its tax plan and without a compromise tax proposal the budget for fiscal 1987/88 ending March 31 is unlikely to be passed soon they said Without the budget the government would also be hard-pressed to come up with an effective package to stimulate the economy as pledged at Group of Seven meetings in Paris in late February and in Washington last week they said Opposition protests against the sales tax have stalled parliamentary debate on the budget for weeks and forced the government to enact a stop-gap 1987/88 budget that began early this month The LDP's election setback will have an enormous impact on the already faltering economy said Johsen Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute Takahashi said that behind the LDP's poor showing was public discontent with the government's high-handed push for tax reform and its lack of effective policies to cope with economic woes caused by the yen's appreciation This explains why the LDP failed to regain governorships in the most hotly contested constituencies of Fukuoka and Hokkaido where the shipbuilding and steel industries are suffering heavily from the yen's extended rise he said Takahashi said the government should delay introduction of the sales tax for one or two years beyond its original starting date of January 1988 and implement tax cuts now 50 manufacturers and trade groups asked the Reagan Administration for exclusions from the tariffs it is to impose on Japanese exports Friday Several police agencies also told a special screening panel they wanted a Japanese-made fingerprinting system to be excluded because it was vital for crime-fighting Another 25 firms are to testify tomorrow President Reagan announced the tariffs on March 27 to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets outside the United States at below cost and to open its own market to US goods US semiconductor makers had complained they were being injured by Japan's unfair trade practices The tariffs of 100 pct - up from about five pct - are to be applied to 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese exports including power tools television sets computer parts and audio equipment in addition to the fingerprinting equipment Reagan issued a list of several dozen products that could be subject to the tariffs and businessmen lobbyists and others asked for the exclusions in the two days of public testimony that began today at the Commerce Department He said action should be taken in such a manner that efforts to help the semiconductor industry do not inflict extensive economic damage on the highly successful information technology industry A spokesman for Amdahl Corp <AMH> a computer maker said it would be hit hard by tariffs on Fujitsu Ltd equipment because Fujitsu was its only supplier of key electronic components Makita USA Inc a maker of hand-held electric power tools said if tariffs were imposed on its goods it would have to close its US manufacturing operation in Buford Ga and layoff its entire US workforce of 600 people The US Trade Representative's Office which is conducting the hearings said the products to be assessed the higher tariffs will be made public on Thursday or Friday It said it would base its judgment on the impact of the tariffs on the companies hit as well as on the buying public Some of the tariffs would double the price of imports Law officers from California Illinois Alaska and elsewhere said they relied on NEC Corp of Japan's advanced fingerprinting system and asked it be exempt from the new tariffs Fred Wynbrandt representing the California attorney general's office said the tariffs would double California state and local costs for fingerprinting operations Many of those testifying backed the idea of retaliatory tariffs but not on some goods that would hit their business Vico Henriques president of the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association called for exemptions for components that US firms bought in Japan and for goods made in Japan under a US license or by a joint venture more of the United States' largest aerospace firms are competing with some of the world's most powerful nations for a chance to cash in on the coming commercialization of space The newest space race is for contracts to launch privately owned satellites into orbit - a business expected to be worth two billion to five billion dlrs annually in a few years The growing opportunities to make money in space will be highlighted this month when the US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration seeks lucrative commercial bids to lauch future weather satellites ending its long-standing dependence on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Companies and countries with established satellite launching operations may also get a jump on eventually providing other space-based services particularly if the proposed international manned space station is launched as planned in the early 1990s The 12 billion dlr space station first proposed by President Reagan in 1984 could require as many as 16 cargo deliveries a year many delivered by private firms The partners in the space station are currently slated to be Canada Japan and the 13-nation European Space Agency the latter two of which also have or are developing their own commercial space programs Until the Challenger explosion in January 1986 NASA had a virtual lock on the world's commercial space cargo But after a re-evaluation of the shuttle program President Reagan declared last August that future US shuttle flights will no longer carry commercial payloads The administration's decision left Arianespace a French-led European consortium the only option available to satellite owners and the concern quickly sold out all its planned flights through 1989 The company also raised its prices from 30000 dlrs a launch to 50000 dlrs but even the larger price tag did not dampen demand Arianespace sighned 18 new contracts last year compared with 11 in 1985 Those kind of tariffs have caused even non-capitalist countries to try and get a piece of the action China the Soviet Union and Japan have all announced satellite launch programs and several US firms including McDonnell Douglas Corp General Dynamics Corp and Martin Marietta promised to spend mlns of dollars over the next three years to develop their own satellite launch capabilities There will be some tremendous pent-up demand for satellite launches by then analysts said Without Challenger there were only three satellite launches last year 15 fewer than in 1985 and the lowest since 1980 when only two were sent up Ariane expects to launch from six to eight satellites a year for the next three years about 75 pct of the world's satellite launches during that period McDonnell Douglas scored the biggest coup of the US firms in January when it won a 734 mln dlr US Air Force pact for up to 20 unmanned rockets to launch military satellites The contract is expected to underwrite the company's efforts to build rockets for private satellite launches Martin Marietta however was the first US company to sign up a client Federal Express Co Marietta plans to launch an ExpressStar communications satellite in 1989 Marietta said it will also build a version of its Titan rockets used by the Air Force to other private companies that want to get into the satellite launch buisiness Arianespace director Charles Bigot said the US companies will probably become the European firm's biggest competitors for satellite launching He does not expect the national space programs to become commercially viable until the late 1990s Japan has expanded its space program launching 38 government-owned satellites in the last 16 years But most of them were small and it was only in February it launched its first satellite that circles the earth over the poles Japan also has yet to design and build its own rockets The satellite launched in February was placed in orbit by a McDonnell Douglas-designed Delta rocket assembled by the Japanese under license Tsugo Tadakawa director of the Washington office of Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) said Japan plans to launch seven of its H-1 rockets an American Japanese hybrid that replaces the Delta through 1991 Its much larger sucessor the H-II should be ready by 1992 he said NASDA's annual budget is only about 800 mln dlrs Tadakawa said about 10 pct the size of NASA's yearly spending Still NASDA is free from private competition at home and has the full support of the government since aerospace was chosen by the Ministry of Trade and Information as one of the country's new industries for the next decade Surprisingly the People's Republic of China a relative newcomer to aerospace is so far the most successful competitor to Ariane The country's Great Wall Industry Corp is the only national program besides the European consortium to win a private satellite contract It will launch a Westar communications satellite for New-York based Terasat in 1988 House officials said no progress had been made in talks with Japan on a dispute on Japanese microchip sales President Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci told reporters it looks like a very difficult situation at this point The Reagan administration is due to slap 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese products on Friday in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to honor an agreement to stop dumping semiconductors in world markets outside the US and failure to open its own market to US goods White House chief of staff Howard Baker said that talks with the Japanese had failed to provide any reason to prevent the publication of a proclamation on Friday putting the new duties in effect I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday Baker said Carlucci said that the evidence of Japanese microchip dumping at below production costs in third countries had been fairly conclusive He said that in US-Japanese talks that concluded last Friday Japanese officials presented statistics to show that Japan had made its market more open to American products Our statistics do not confirm this indeed they tend to go in the other direction Carlucci said Baker and Carlucci appeared before White House reporters as Reagan enjoyed a vacation at his mountaintop ranch near Santa Barbara between the United States and Japan on alleged Japanese dumping of computer microchips have failed to head off US imposition of retaliatory tariffs two senior White House officials said President Reagan's chief of staff Howard Baker told reporters here that he saw no developments that that would cause the president to back away from his plan to issue a proclamation on Friday slapping 100 per cent tariffs on a range of Japanese electronic products I assume that there will be a proclamation on Friday Baker said Reagan's National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci added It looks like a very difficult situation at this point Carlucci said that evidence of Japanese dumping of microchips had been fairly conclusive The alleged dumping -- selling abroad at below the cost of manufacture -- is said to have undercut the technologically important US microchip industry Carlucci also said that although Japanese officials had presented statistics designed to show that Japan was opening its markets to American producers of microchips our statistics do not confirm this Indeed they tend to go in the other directionCarlucci said President Reagan announced on March 27 that he planned to raise tariffs on as much as 300 mln dlrs in Japanese exports to the United States He accused Japan of failing to enforce major provisions of a September 1986 agreement on preventing microchip dumping and providing American industry with fair trade opportunities He said he would be prepared to lift the sanctions when Japan took corrective action on these two issues The dispute has soured US-Jpanese relations as Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone prepares to visit Washington at the end of the month for talks with Reagan Last Friday Reagan answering questions following a speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council said Nakasone had endangered his political standing at home because of his willingess to try to eliminate trade barriers against US goods He said he was looking forward to his talks with Nakasone and he has been most helpful Today Reagan was vacationing at his ranch near here Motors Corp is being awarded a 97 mln dlr Air Force contract for 176 turboprop engines in three separate designs the Defense Department said It said the contract which combines purchases for the US Navy the US Air Force Reserves Japan and Norway under the Foreign Military Sales program is expected to be completed in December 1987 Bank of Japan intervened in Tokyo to buy dollars just after the market opened dealers said The dollar opened at 14205 yen against 14215/25 in New York and 14250 at the close here yesterday The bank stepped into the market amid selling pressure from interbank dealers dealers said Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference he expects the US Trade deficit to eventually start reflecting economic fundamentals which should influence exchange rates The minister was not referring to the US Trade data to be released in Washington later today Miyazawa also said he told major industrial nations when he was in Washington last week that present exchange rates are not necessarily good He had said earlier in Washington that current exchange rates were within levels implied in the February Paris currency accord formal talks have been scheduled yet among companies involved in a controversial proposal to merge two groups seeking to enter Japan's international telecommunications sector an official from one group said Nothing has been firmed up yet said an official at <International Digital Communications Planning Inc> (IDC) one of the groups set up last year to study competing against <Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which monopolises the sector Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc <CAWLL> which holds a 20 pct share in IDC has opposed plans to merge with rival group <International Telecom Japan Inc> Under the plan backed by the Post and Telecommunications Ministry Cable and Wireless and US-based <Pacific Telesis International Inc> would become core companies in the merged firm with shares equal to those of the six major Japanese core companies and seats on the board of directors Britain angry over what it feels are moves to restrict Cable and Wireless' role in the sector views the issue as a test case The IDC official declined to specify what was holding up the talks A spokesman for C Itoh and Co Ltd <CITTT> which holds 20 pct of IDC said a meeting may be held later this week broadly defined money supply average of M-2 plus certificate of deposits (CD) rose a preliminary 90 pct in March from a year earlier compared with an 88 pct rise in February the Bank of Japan said The seasonally adjusted March average of M-2 plus CDs rose 08 pct from February when it rose an identical 08 pct from a month earlier it said Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs stood at an average 343600 billion yen in March compared with 336015 billion in February in financial centres in Asia generally welcomed the first US Night session of futures trading which starts in Chicago on April 30 Traders in Japan Sydney and Hong Kong said they expected the move to bring benefits but traders and bankers in Singapore said it posed a serious threat to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in Washington gave unanimous approval to the Chicago Board of Trade's (CBT) proposals on Tuesday The CBT plans to offer futures on US Treasury notes and bonds and options on those futures from 1800 to 2100 hrs Chicago time (2300 to 0200 gmt) on Mondays to Thursdays The sessions would mark the start of the trading day which would end at the present close of business the next day The proposed hours are designed to coincide with the busiest morning trading hours in Japan But Andrea Corcoran chief of CFTC's division of trading and markets said on Tuesday she expected the evening sessions to attract primarily US Firms looking for additional overnight protection Traders in Tokyo said the night sessions were expected to help expand US Treasury bond trading volume and enlarge daily fluctuation ranges in Tokyo They said Japanese financial institutions were very interested in using overseas futures markets but were waiting for finance ministry approval to do so Approval is expected before the end of the month The foreign branches of financial institutions can already trade futures but in practice make little use of them But traders said the timing of the launch was poor as it is in a ten day period when Tokyo has three public holidays The Tokyo traders said because of the holidays little interest in night trading could be expected until after May 5 Tokyo bond managers said also that participation could be limited by a lack of experienced futures traders in Tokyo The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hoped the four-hour trading overlap with the new CBT hours would boost activity in Sydney's eurodollar and US Treasury bond contracts spokesman Stephen Calder said The eurodollar contracts are linked to the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) Calder said turnover in both contracts had been disappointingly low since they were introduced last October He said the CBT move would broaden arbitraging opportunities for SFE traders With a late evening lead from Chicago there's also more chance that people will deal here in the afternoon he said But in Singapore news of the CBT move was not welcomed A senior executive of a Japanese securities firm operating in Singapore told Expanding global links between futures markets mean that SIMEX must add Chicago and London and Sydney to its list of rivals LIFFE could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a US treasury bond contract that can be off-set on the CBOT the Singapore-based Japanese trader said Such a contract is expected later this year he said Other SIMEX traders said local interest in the Sydney treasury bond contract might be boosted if the Sydney exchange established a three-way link with Chicago and London LIFFE has signed a memorandum of understanding with CBOT for such a link If this link-up materializes most traders are likely to by-pass SIMEX said one trader Hong Kong commodity traders welcomed the CFTC's decision though they added that local investors would have been more interested in financial futures I think it is very good because the move will help us to increase our market share here said Joseph Tan manager of <Bache Securities (HK) Ltd> He said that Bache like many other local units of US Commodity houses had been participating in Chicago's rregular hours of trading for a long time and would like to extend its business Local Hong Kong houses also welcomed the move but a spokesman for Shun Loong Co said investors would be more interested if stock index or currency futures were available Futures contracts in the local Hang Seng index have become increasingly popular since they were introduced to the market in May 1986 (See ECRA for Spotlight Index) vehicle exports fell 38 pct to 659 mln in the year ended March 31 1987 while vehicle output fell 12 pct to 1227 mln industry sources said Toyota Motor

Arabia hopes to increase the volume of its oil exports to Japan through expanding bilateral trade Saudi Arabian Interior Minister Naif bin Abdul-Aziz said He told a Tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude and products exports to Japan to earlier levels but did not elaborate To promote trade Saudi Arabia is inviting Japanese industries to do business there he said Japanese firms now have long-term contracts to import a total of 150000 barrels per day of Saudi crude Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters Hideo Maki Director General of the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng who is here to dicuss farm trade However Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world's largest grain importer Kato added Japan is the largest customer for US Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985 Lyng said the US Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in US Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year as well as on beef citrus products and rice Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries he added Lyng said the US Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs Maki said Maki said the US And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20 in which US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join Nippon Printing Co Ltd <DPRIT> said it will issue three convertible yen bonds on domestic markets It will issue a 25 billion yen 15-year bond through public placement with Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd as lead manager It will also issue a 15 billion yen 10-year bond and a 10 billion yen six-year bond through public placement both with Nomura Securities Co Ltd as lead manager Coupon and conversion price for the par-priced bonds will be set at Dai Nippon's next board meeting Payment will be due on June 1 The 15-year bond will mature on May 31 2002 the 10-year on May 30 1997 and the six-year on May 31 1993 Dai Nippon's share price rose 20 to 1800 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today Finance Ministry is likely to allow Japanese financial institutions here to use overseas financial futures market from next month bond market sources said A senior ministry official declined to give an exact timing but said he expects removal of the ban on trading in overseas financial futures as soon as possible The domestic call for participation in overseas markets to hedge foreign securities holding risks was reinforced by the launch of a night trading session by the Chicago Board of Trade from April 30 The session covers morning trading hours in Tokyo Resident financial institutions are currently not allowed to participate in foreign financial futures markets although their overseas branches may The newly eligible institutions are expected to be securities houses banks life insurance companies and investment trusts the market sources said But the ministry is likely to prohibit broking business by those institutions and by individuals the sources said In addition corporate investors are expected to be barred initially because of their relative lack of experience ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will call for adequate and flexible management of the nation's monetary polices in its plan to expand domestic demand a senior LDP official told Junichiro Koizumi the head of the LDP committee working out the plan said the phrase should not be taken as implying an immediate cut in Japan's 25 pct discount rate The LDP generally believes that there is no need for a further discount rate cut at the moment he said But Koizumi said the LDP does not rule out a rate cut if necessary in the future Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a press conference on Wednesday that the central bank does not have any intention of easing credit conditions Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods the head of the committee working out the plan Junichiro Koizumi said The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's official development assistance to 76 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised senior LDP officials said at a press conference LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to US Officials when he visits the US On April 19 Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated However top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to US Officials The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers LDP officials said specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries the officials said The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the US They added The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week they said The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May reform of Japan's protected farm sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to domestic-led growth a vital step if it is to trim its trade surplus securities analysts said The farm sector which is protected by import tariffs and quotas propped up by subsidies and price supports and sheltered by the tax system has ample room for change they said In economic terms reform would be a plus said Christopher Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the US The analysts said Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross national product (GNP) according to a study by Chew Reducing these prices could increase household spending power by five pct his study said The money could be spent on products which would have a more direct impact in boosting domestic growth it added There's a lot of slack a US Government official in Tokyo said All that money could be spent on something else Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector amount to some five billion dlrs per year Independent estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37 billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential development would also give a boost to domestic spending economists said Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the expansion of domestic demand wrote Chihiro Nakajima professor at Kyoto Gakuen University Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the farm sector Employers groups also want change If you really want to expand domestic demand the way to do it is not to raise wages recklessly but to reduce commodity prices Bumpei Otsuki President of the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations told a recent press conference External pressures are rising as the US And Europe seek removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade deficits with Japan But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well entrenched dimming prospects for quick reform analysts said Although the full-time farm population is falling and there are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban constituencies the ruling party remains heavily dependent on farm votes in the rural areas One rural vote is worth several city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon the analysts said Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for national food security they said Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to import liberalisation but are more flexible about reforms aimed at stepping up productivity they said Reform when it comes will be in response to specific pressure rather than an all-embracing program said Chew Bank of Japan said it forecast Japan's broadly-defined M-2 money supply average plus certificates of deposit (CDs) will rise by about nine pct in the current April-June quarter against 85 pct a year earlier Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs rose a preliminary 88 pct in January/March 1987 compared with a nine pct rise a year earlier it said The bank said the forecast rise is due to an increase in floating deposits due to recent low interest rates and a shift to private banks from the Bank of Japan of 400-1000 billion yen by the recently privatised Japanese Railways plan to stimulate its economy will inject about 5000 billion yen into the economy and should be appreciated by the US Ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) executive council chairman Shintaro Abe told reporters I expect considerable US Appreciation of measures I have personally prepared with cooperation of the government and the LDP to help solve some individual issues pending with the United States he said Abe former Foreign Minister starts a week long visit to Washington on Sunday Abe said he will meet President Reagan Vice President George Bush Secretary of State George Shultz Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger Treasury Secretary James Baker White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and as many Congressmen as possible Washington is likely to announce today a series of tariff sanctions against Japanese electrical products after it accused Tokyo of failing to meet terms of a 1986 bilateral pact on computer chip trade I will ask US Leaders to rescind any sanctions said Abe Japanese officials have said Tokyo would appeal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for possible compensation or the right to retaliate should US Sanctions materialise But Abe said We should not repeat retaliatory measures What I would like to say to the United States is retaliation or protectionism alone cannot solve our trade disputes European Community (EC) is ready to take measures to ensure that Japanese exports expected to be effectively excluded from the US Market from today are not diverted to the EC a spokesman said President Reagan is expected to announce later today the imposition of 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods ranging from computers and television sets to power tools and photographic film The spokesman for the EC executive Commission said representatives of member states last Friday agreed a series of measures to prevent Tokyo deflecting exports to the EC The spokesman declined to detail the measures saying they were technical and the Commission would decide their precise content depending on the exact details of the measures announced by Reagan The EC fears Tokyo will step up exports to it of a range of products including calculating machines measuring instruments small televisions tapes and some machine tools as a result of the US Measures But the spokesman said there was thought to be ample time to put the countermeasures in place after the Easter holiday He noted the probable outline of Reagan's announcement and its date have been known for some time The Japanese manufacturers of goods likely to be affected by the announcement are thought to have been stepping up their exports to the United States in recent weeks in order to beat the April 17 deadline he noted They were therefore unlikely to have stocks available for export to the EC immediately he said Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected But in an interview with during the flight to Tokyo yesterday Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets (The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming but they are not going to give us anything Lyng said US Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng's two-week visit here Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month they said If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him when he visits Washington later in the month one US Official said Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases A private US Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake Japan has rejected the overture saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed He cited the example of a California company which transports live US Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal he said US Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports Along with beef the US Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April 1988 Some US Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice US And Japanese officials have said Lyng has resurrected a past US Proposal that Japan buy surplus US Foodgrains for donation to developing countries but some US Officials are skeptical action will be taken Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies including rice on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible US Reprisals in financial centers in Asia generally welcomed the first US Night session of futures trading which starts in Chicago on April 30 Traders in Japan Sydney and Hong Kong said they expected the move to bring benefits but traders and bankers in Singapore said it posed a serious threat to the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in Washington gave unanimous approval to the Chicago Board of Trade's (CBT) proposals on Tuesday The CBT plans to offer futures on US Treasury notes and bonds and options on those futures from 1800 to 2100 hrs Chicago time (2300 to 0200 gmt) on Mondays to Thursdays The sessions would mark the start of the trading day which would end at the present close of business the next day The proposed hours are designed to coincide with the busiest morning trading hours in Japan But Andrea Corcoran chief of CFTC's division of trading and markets said on Tuesday she expected the evening sessions to attract primarily US Firms looking for additional overnight protection Traders in Tokyo said the night sessions were expected to help expand US Treasury bond trading volume and enlarge daily fluctuation ranges in Tokyo They said Japanese financial institutions were very interested in using overseas futures markets but were waiting for finance ministry approval to do so Approval is expected before the end of the month The foreign branches of financial institutions can already trade futures but in practice make little use of them But traders said the timing of the launch was poor as it is in a ten day period when Tokyo has three public holidays The Tokyo traders said because of the holidays little interest in night trading could be expected until after May 5 Tokyo bond managers said also that participation could be limited by a lack of experienced futures traders in Tokyo The Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hoped the four-hour trading overlap with the new CBT hours would boost activity in Sydney's eurodollar and US Treasury bond contracts spokesman Stephen Calder said The eurodollar contracts are linked to the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) Calder said turnover in both contracts had been disappointingly low since they were introduced last October He said the CBT move would broaden arbitraging opportunities for SFE traders With a late evening lead from Chicago there's also more chance that people will deal here in the afternoon he said But in Singapore news of the CBT move was not welcomed A senior executive of a Japanese securities firm operating in Singapore told Expanding global links between futures markets mean that SIMEX must add Chicago and London and Sydney to its list of rivals LIFFE could cut further into the SIMEX contract with a US treasury bond contract that can be off-set on the CBOT the Singapore-based Japanese trader said Such a contract is expected later this year he said Other SIMEX traders said local interest in the Sydney treasury bond contract might be boosted if the Sydney exchange established a three-way link with Chicago and London LIFFE has signed a memorandum of understanding with CBOT for such a link If this link-up materializes most traders are likely to by-pass SIMEX said one trader Hong Kong commodity traders welcomed the CFTC's decision though they added that local investors would have been more interested in financial futures I think it is very good because the move will help us to increase our market share here said Joseph Tan manager of <Bache Securities (HK) Ltd> He said that Bache like many other local units of US Commodity houses had been participating in Chicago's rregular hours of trading for a long time and would like to extend its business Local Hong Kong houses also welcomed the move but a spokesman for Shun Loong Co said investors would be more interested if stock index or currency futures were available Futures contracts in the local Hang Seng index have become increasingly popular since they were introduced to the market in May 1986 (See ECRA for Spotlight Index) Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an increase in government purchases of foreign goods the head of the committee working out the plan Junichiro Koizumi said The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's official development assistance to 76 billion dlrs within five years instead of seven as the government had promised senior LDP officials said at a press conference LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain the plan to US Officials when he visits the US On April 19 Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated However top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe will be able to offer specifics to US Officials The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by the government will probably include the purchase of super computers LDP officials said According to the plan Japan will also strive to solve specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage flows of funds to developing countries the officials said The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and lessen trade problems with the US They added The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial nations in Washington last week they said The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be unveiled by the government in late May Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters Hideo Maki Director General of the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng who is here to dicuss farm trade However Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world's largest grain importer Kato added Japan is the largest customer for US Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985 Lyng said the US Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in US Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year as well as on beef citrus products and rice Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries he added Lyng said the US Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs Maki said Maki said the US And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20 in which US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join Reagan today is to announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair practices in semiconductor trade The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of experts headed by the US Trade Representative's Office Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors and television sets to power tools and photographic film The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some 20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa Barbara where Reagan is vacationing In his March annoucement Reagan said I am committed to full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade opportunities He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and opened its home market to US products US officials said Japan had done nothing since the March announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday: we do not want a trade war but we feel that this is the kind of action that requires meaningful action Reagan's move follows steadily rising US trade deicits with last year's hitting a record $1698 billion About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices He has opposed the legislation saying it would prevent negotiated solutions to trade disputes and in any case that existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not need any new trade legislation The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring the semiconductor pact but that it would take time before the results showed up US officials however have said their monitoring of Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs it would file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) It said hoped GATT would find the US retaliation had violated the regulations of the global trading group and would approve compensation or Japanese retaliation US officials have said they did not think Japan would retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with the United States Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned Asked in a television interview what the chance was for Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese electronic exports he said slim to none Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home markets to US products Yeutter on the NBC program Today said the United States did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement He said Japanese negotiators last week told US officials they were honoring the pact but Yeutter said it would take time to monitor any compliance Asked how long that would take he said We want to see a pattern of compliance so in a minimum I would say that would take a few weeks Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods because the items selected are also readily available from other countries and manufacturers He said he did not think Japan would retaliate It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country to get in an escalating conflict The Japanese understand that full well Yeutter said He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) but that's more of a paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any adverse impact on US trade Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone He said he hoped the visit which is to have trade as a major issue would be productive but I don't see any practical way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his visit Corp> of Japan plans to launch a 15-mln-dlr project here soon to produce video and music cassette tapes mainly for export Chira Phanupong head of Thailand's Board of Investment said Chira told reporters Sony will likely receive investment tax incentives from his agency which is in charge of promoting foreign investment The BoI chief said most small and medium Japanese firms view Thailand as the best country in South East Asia to which they could shift their high-cost production facilities in the wake of the strong yen BoI officials said the number of new Japanese investment projects seeking promotional privileges from the Thai government increased substantially in the past year as the stronge yen forced more Japanese companies to look for cheaper production bases abroad <Sharp Corp> recently also obtained BoI tax incentives to invest in a project here to produce microwave ovens and refrigerators for the Thai market and for export Chira said a big Japanese electronic firm is negotiating with his agency for Thai tax incentives for its project to manufacture audio equipment and other electrical appliances here He declined to name the Japanese company but said its proposed project will provide employment for 50000 Thais in five years Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's unpopular sales tax plan suffered another dent today when members of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called for time to be taken in dealing with the proposed sales tax party officials said The call came in a resolution adopted by a group of some 150 LDP parliamentarians and secretaries acting on behalf of their parliamentarians at a meeting at the LDP headquarters they said The MPs represented seemed to Account for one-third of LDP MPs The group is an LDP voluntary organisation called the Parliamentarians' Research Society for Reestablishment of Finances claiming a membership of about 300 MPs they said Meanwhle Nakasone this evening hinted that his party might be ready to accept some modification to the five-pct sales tax proposal after the fiscal 1987 state budget plan was passed by parliament The LDP suffered a setback in last Sunday's local elections because of the controvertial tax plan The result also undermined Nakasone's prestige giving rise to a possibility that he might be forced out of office before October 30 when he is supposed to step down White House announced 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese electronic goods effective Friday The tariffs were imposed because of alleged Japanese failure to honor an agreement to stop below cost dumping of computer microchips on world markets and to open up its domestic markets to American goods I regret that these actions were necessary President Reagan said in a statement Reagan said the tariffs would be eliminated as soon as we have firm and continuing evidence that the dumping in third country markets has stopped and that access to the Japanese market has improved He said he was encouraged by recent actions by Tokyo to improve compliance with the US-Japanese semiconductor agreement and he looked forward to the day when it was working as effectively as it should White House issued a list of Japanese exports to covered by the 100 pct tariffs imposed by President Reagan - Automatic data processing machines (1986 imports worth 180 mln dlrs) including certain desk and lap models with microprocessor-based calculating mechanism capable of handling words of at least 16-bits off the microprocessor; - Complete color television sets with 18 19 or 20 inch screens (1986 imports 90 mln dlrs); - Power tools including certain drills percussion hammers sanders polishers grinders Japanese Embassy said in a statement it was deeply disappointed by the tariffs announced by President Reagan in retaliation for Japan's not honoring its semiconductor agreement with the United States It said Japan had been fully implementing the pact to end dumping semiconductors in world markets and to open its home market to US goods and the results were starting to show The embassy said Japan would complain to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as it said it would and seek new talks with Washington to resolve the issue as soon as possible tough trade sanctions President Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide US officials said But Robert Crandall a trade specialist at Brookings Institution a think tank said a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern He said it left the United States open to retaliation The US officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed In the past year tough trade action had been taken against the European Community over corn and sorghum Taiwan over beer and wine South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to US products The tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the American consumer Fitzwater said Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing US trade deficit The alternative was that if he did not Congress would The US trade gap last year was a record 1698 billion dlrs and continues to rise with Japan accounting for about one-third of America's overall deficit But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada West Germany Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that I regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the US semiconductor industry was essential to American competitiveness in world markets We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices Reagan added in the statement from his California vacation home at Santa Barbara He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan abided by the agreement US officials say the action today will show Congress - which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade The White House aide said of the tariff action it wasn't done to appease Congress but because there was an unfair trade practice The aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws But the analyst Crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the United States and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade Crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on Congress He said I don't think it makes a lot of sense But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at US trading partners or Congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use Spokesman Fitzwater said we don't want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated Crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on Congress He said I don't think it makes a lot of sense But other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at US trading partners or Congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use Spokesman Fitzwater said we don't want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he was almost sure Japan would not retaliate against tariffs President Reagan slapped on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese electronic goods today I'd say it's 99 plus pct sure that it (the tariffs) will not provoke a retaliation on American products Yeutter told Cable News Network Japan has far too much at stake in this relationship (with the United States) to seriously entertain thoughts of retaliation Yeutter said Earlier today Reagan imposed 100 pct tariffs on a range of Japanese goods in retaliation for Japan's alleged violation of a bilateral pact governing semiconductor trade Yeutter did say that US farm products would be targeted if Tokyo decided to hit back If they (Japan) were to retaliate it would probably be on something like American agricultural products he said But I really think the chances of that happening are between slim and none he added does not plan to take immediate retaliatory action against implementation of US Tariffs on some Japanese electronic goods the minister of international trade and industry Hajime Tamura said in a statement Japan requested bilateral consultations in accordance with Article 23-1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Washington yesterday Tamura said there was deep regret over the US Measures which will impose 100 pct tariffs on about 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese imports of some small computers colour television sets and power tools coal industry sources said Japanese electricity utilities are demanding price cuts in annual coal contract negotiations underway in Tokyo But the sources said they were unable to substantiate reports here that one of the largest steaming coal customers <Chugoku Electric Power Co Inc> threatened to stop taking deliveries until new prices are set Coal exporters want to maintain last year's 32 US Dlrs a tonne price which expired at the end of Japan's fiscal year on March 31 while the Japanese want to pay no more than the 27-28 US Dlrs secured with China and South Africa Ross McKinnon general manager of <Thiess Dampier Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd> which annually exports about one mln tonnes of steaming coal to Japan mainly to Chugoku told he had not been informed of any refusal to take shipments McKinnon said he could not recall when a Japanese contract had been settled before the previous one had expired and said controlled leaks were commonplace during talks But Australian foreign currency markets took the reports seriously enough for dealers to say it added nervousness to trading with the local dollar settling on 07080 US Cents at midsession against its 07120 opening Coal was Australia's largest single export in the fiscal year ended June 30 1986 with shipments reaching 9049 mln tonnes worth 521 billion dlrs or 159 pct of total exports Japan is the largest customer for the crucial steaming coal sector and took 1497 mln tonnes of total exports of 433 mln tonnes in calendar 1986 Sydney resources analyst Ian Story said the appreciation of the Australian dollar against the US Currency meant steaming coal exporters were now receiving just 4472 dlrs a tonne against 5242 dlrs when last year's contract was negotiated policy of self-sufficiency in rice is an example of extreme protectionism visiting US Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan had a large export balance not just with the US But with other countries it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture minister Mutsuki Kato Lyng said the US Had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice We want to have some access in the rice market he said He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan He told reporters Japan had rejected the US Proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan on rice Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency Asked what the next US Step would be on the rice issue Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the US Rice industry would do Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or August this year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by the US Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in the meantime US Rice industry officials have indicated they would consider filing another complaint against the Japan rice import ban Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Japanese government officials do not seem to understand that protectionist sentiment in the US Could lead to an explosive situation and protectionist legislation Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan Lyng said protectionist sentiment in the US Has increased alarmingly during the last six months It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory laws which would have very serious consequences for other countries especially Japan Lyng told reporters Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision requiring retaliation against countries which have trade surpluses with the US Trade analysts said US House majority leader Thomas Foley a Washington Democrat yesterday predicted during a visit here that the Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade legislation is taken up later this month Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the volatility of the situation in the US Where Congress is increasingly unpredictable he said The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington I cannot emphasise that enough Lyng said In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato yesterday Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import quotas on beef and citrus Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the US Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response in Congress where legislation on rice retaliation has been introduced in both the House and Senate Lyng said the US Is dependent on Japan as a market for exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of US Farm products since 1964 especially grains He said the US Understands Japan with a limited land area is concerned about maintaining some level of self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture Lyng pledged the US Will never again embargo shipments of farm products as it did in 1973 Bank of Japan intervened in the market to try to accelerate the dollar's rise after heavy dollar buying by institutional investors dealers said The central bank bought a moderate amount of dollars at around 14210 yen they said Bank of Japan is carefully watching the recent rapid rise of the Tokyo stock and yen bond markets for their impact on inflation governor Satoshi Sumita said In a statement to the bank's regional branch managers Sumita said the central bank was particularly monitoring the markets because of the recent rapid growth of money supply He said he is also carefully watching real estate prices Sumita said he expects money supply growth to remain high from April through June In March money supply as measured by M-2 plus certificates of deposit rose at a year-on-year rate of nine pct Korea unveiled plans to boost industrial and agricultural production sharply over the next seven years and to greatly expand its foreign trade Prime Minister Li Gun-mo told the eighth Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang that North Korea intends to increase international trade by 220 pct in the period 1987/93 gross industrial output by 90 pct and agricultural production by 40 pct according to the North Korean Central News Agency monitored here Korea unveiled plans to boost industrial and agricultural production over the next seven years and to greatly expand trade with other nations the official North Korean Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo reported Prime Minister Li Gun-mo told the eighth Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang agricultural production will rise 14 times in the period of the new seven-year plan the agency said For a more satisfactory solution of the problem of food clothing and housing for the people a 15 mln tonne target of grain will be hitAnd 15 billion metres of textiles will be produced annually he said Annual output of non-ferrous metals will be lifted to more than 17 mln tonnes in the seven year plan the agency quoted Li as saying During the previous seven-year plan North Korea achieved annual output of 10 mln tonnes of grain Chemical fertilizer production hit an annual target of five mln tonnes He did not provide any other figures General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will begin a probe on May 7-8 on the legality of Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products Agriculture Ministry officials said The investigation which will take place in Geneva follows a US Complaint last year that the restrictions violated GATT rules prohibiting import quotas The products involved include fruit juice peanuts and tomato juice Japanese government is considering buying US-made supercomputers to help defuse mounting trade friction between the two countries Trade Minister Hajime Tamura was quoting as saying Japanese officials said Tamura told visiting US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter that the government may set aside money for the purchase of the supercomputers in a supplementary budget to be drawn up later this year But he emphasised that the matter was still under study and that no firm decision had been made Tamura urged Yeutter to lift the trade sanctions imposed against Japan and argued that the yen's rapid rise was already working to correct the country's trade imbalance But according to Japanese officials Yeutter held out little hope that the American trade sanctions would be lifted soon and said the United States needed action from Japan to boost its domestic demand and imports not just words In order to lift the tariffs imposed on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese exports last Friday the US Needs proof that its joint computer chip pact with Japan is working And that will take time Yeutter was quoted as telling Tamura is faced with a mounting crisis over its huge trade surplus and recognizes that it must act more quickly to refocus its export driven economy a senior Foreign Ministry official said The sense of crisis among the Japanese public as well as the government is increasing Deputy Director General Hiroshi Hirabayashi told reporters The need to accelerate the efforts (to restructure the economy) is well recognized Hirabayashi said that gradual progress had been made to refocus the Japanese economy but admitted that it might not seem all that spectacular to foreign observers Difficulties had been encountered in implementing the so-called Maekawa report since it was unveiled a year ago he said But he added foreign governments should appreciate the efforts that have been made The report named for its principal author former Bank of Japan governor Haruo Maekawa called for a shift in Japan's economy away from its dependence on exports for growth The Japanese cabinet today reviewed progress made since its release According to Hirabayashi Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told his fellow ministers that Japan must follow the direction set out by Maekawa and urged them to make efforts to achieve it Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari added that not enough had been done to publicize the action Japan was taking to refocus its economy Listing some of those actions Hirabayashi said imports of manufactured goods have increased interest rates have fallen and coal steel and non-ferrous metal output have been reduced He expressed hope that Japan will act more quickly in the future to implement the report and scoffed at a suggestion that it would take ten years for Maekawa's goals to be met It will not take very much time to fulfill the (goals) set out by the Maekawa report he said bought 4000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for last-half May/first-half June shipment nearly completing buying for May needs trade sources said Price details were not available Japanese envoy Shintaro Abe said in a brief interview with that the feeling in the US congress is very severe against Japan However Abe said he believed that neither Congress nor the Reagan administration wants to undermine relations with Japan He said the Reagan administration showed relative understanding of how Japan is trying to alleviate its US trade imbalance Abe said he was convinced Congress and the administration had the same view that the relationship between Tokyo and Washington should not be undermined Lower House passed the 1987 budget after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party agreed to a mediation proposal that could kill its plan to introduce a controversial sales tax political analysts said The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone the leading advocate of the five pct tax Some analysts predicted Nakasone might be forced to step down just after the June summit of leaders from major industrial democracies well before his one-year term is due to expire at the end of October The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget before Nakasone leaves next week for the US so that he could tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to boost the sagging economy and imports Lower House passed the 1987 budget shortly before midnight local time official parliamentary sources said The move followed agreement by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a proposal that could kill its plan to introduce a controversial sales tax political analysts said The move was seen as a major blow to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone the leading advocate of the five pct tax they said Some analysts said Nakasone may be forced to step down after the June summit of heads of major industrial democracies and before his one-year term is due to expire at end-October Under the compromise agreed by the LDP and opposition parties Lower House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara will take charge of the sales tax bill appoint a ruling/opposition party council to debate it and allow opposition leaders to review the present tax system analysts said Hara also verbally agreed to scrap the sales tax plan entirely if the joint council fails to reach agreement on how to handle the tax The opposition parties who have been vociferously attacking the sales tax plan for months hailed the decision as a great victory The opposition parties had already delayed passage of the budget for three weeks after the April 1 start of the fiscal year by intermittent parliamentary boycotts Although the LDP had more than enough votes to ram the budget through parliament it had been reluctant to do so for fear of a backlash of public opinion especially after its setback in recent local elections due to the sales tax issue The ruling party though was anxious to pass the budget before Nakasone leaves next week for the US So that he could tell Washington the Japanese government was doing its utmost to boost the sagging economy and imports According to Kyodo News Service Nakasone told reporters he did not think the sales tax was dead If the sales tax is dropped it could prove a major boost to the economy because it would increase the government budget deficit economists said The sales tax was originally scheduled to be introduced next January to help offset the loss of government revenues stemming from a cut in income and corporate taxes due to go into effect this month Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support the dollar other than foreign exchange intervention He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the countries involved and the amounts expended he said With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen 0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan might take new measures to support the US Currency such as curbing capital outflows Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 43 pct rise in US Gnp in the first quarter had been expected Although the growth looks robust on the surface the figures in reality are not that good he said He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone Miyazawa said it was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect should look out for possible effects of the yen's recent sharp rise on Japan's economy as growth remains slow the government's Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to cabinet ministers EPA officials told reporters the underlying trend of the economy is firm but growth is slow due to sluggish exports Customs-cleared exports by volume fell 49 pct month-on-month in February after a 28 pct fall in March The government must take adequate economic measures to expand domestic demand and stabilise exchange rates in a bid to ensure sustained econonic growth the report said The report made a special reference to the yen's renewed rise and its effect on the economy the officials said adding the agency's judgement of current economic conditions has not changed since last month The EPA said last month Japan's economy is beginning to show signs of bottoming out conditional upon exchange rates The dollar fell below 139 yen in early trading today - a post-war low Bank of Japan does not intend to ease credit policy further bank officials told They were responding to rumours in the Japanese bond market that the central bank was planning to cut its 25 pct discount rate soon possibly before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29 Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita will be in Osaka western Japan on April 27 and 28 for the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank making a rate cut announcement early next week a virtual impossibility they said April 29 is a holiday here Japanese buyers have accepted postponement of between 150000 and 200000 tonnes of Cuban raw sugar scheduled for delivery in calendar 1987 until next year following a request from Cuba trade sources said Cuba had sought delays for some 300000 tonnes of deliveries they said It made a similar request in January when Japanese buyers agreed to postpone some 200000 tonnes of sugar deliveries for 1987 until 1988 Some buyers rejected the Cuban request because they have already sold the sugar on to refiners they added Japanese buyers are believed to have contracts to buy some 950000 tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba for 1987 shipment But Japan's actual raw sugar imports from Cuba are likely to total only some 400000 to 450000 tonnes this year against 576990 in 1986 reflecting both the postponements and sales earlier this year by Japanese traders of an estimated 150000 tonnes of Cuban sugar to the USSR for 1987 shipment they said They estimated Japan's total sugar imports this year at 18 mln tonnes against 181 mln in 1986 of which Australia is expected to supply 550000 against 470000 South Africa 350000 against 331866 and Thailand 400000 after 390776 Bank of Japan intervened just after the Tokyo market opened to support the dollar from falling below 14000 yen dealers said The central bank bought a moderate amount of dollars to prevent its decline amid bearish sentiment for the US Currency they said The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low of 14000 yen against 14070/80 in New York and 14115 at the close here yesterday The previous Tokyo low was 14055 yen set on April 15 should look out for possible effects of the yen's recent sharp rise on Japan's economy as growth remains slow the government's Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to cabinet ministers EPA officials told reporters the underlying trend of the economy is firm but growth is slow due to sluggish exports Customs-cleared exports by volume fell 49 pct month-on-month in February after a 28 pct fall in March The government must take adequate economic measures to expand domestic demand and stabilise exchange rates in a bid to ensure sustained econonic growth the report said The report made a special reference to the yen's renewed rise and its effect on the economy the officials said adding the agency's judgement of current economic conditions has not changed since last month The EPA said last month Japan's economy is beginning to show signs of bottoming out conditional upon exchange rates The dollar fell below 139 yen in early trading today - a post-war low Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's unpopular sales tax plan has been defeated and although fellow politicians and political analysts agree he has suffered a grave loss of face only a few are willing to write him off Michio Watanabe a Nakasone faction member and deputy secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party LDP is one of those who believes he will survive He's tough he won't step down but will hang on to the death at least until his term ends on October 30 Watanabe told The sales tax scheme was a mainstay in Nakasone's plans to revamp the nation's tax system for the first time in 36 years Watanabe acknowledged that the five pct sales tax was a mistake It was too greedy he said A two or three pct tariff might have been easier to swallow he said One popular school of thought among skeptical analysts is that Nakasone will be remain in office at least until the June 8-10 summit of industrialised nations in Venice A Western diplomatic observer said he believed that Nakasone would be at the summit as prime minister But he would not bet on his chances of survival up until October Masamichi Inoki a senior fellow at the conservative Institute of Peace and Security said he did not think Nakasone had suffered irreparable damage He will certainly hang on for the summit Inoki said In any event the general belief now is that the five pct sales tax as championed by Nakasone is a dead issue but that an indirect tax in another form will be introduced by the LDP Inoki said he believed the issue would be resurrected as early as the next Diet (parliament) meets The current session finishes on May 27 The newspaper Tokyo Shimbun expressed another stream of opinion stating that Nakasone might well get another year to deal with the unfinished and unpopular business of tax reform The government has to find a way of generating revenue to support an expected glut of elderly Japanese And the only means of drumming up the money is to levy an indirect tax said Watanabe a former Minister of International Trade and Industry The next prime minister will have to grapple with an indirect tax and whoever is the next prime minister won't be in the job very long Watanabe said Watanabe said he doubted the next prime minister would be any of the three so-called New Leaders LDP secretary general Noboru Takeshita LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa Each of them controls a powerful LDP faction It will be somebody else he said Political science professor Rei Shiratori of Dokkyo University gave one of the darkest readings on Nakasone's political future Soon after the Venice summit there will be a move to change the government by the New Leaders Shiratori said He can't fight on he said He said Nakasone had a special emotional attachment to the sales tax plan as the last and most important item in Japan's purge of policies inherited from the US Occupation Shiratori said an indirect tax will have to be levied but to introduce such a tax they'll have to change the prime minister Nevertheless Shiratori said he believes Nakasone could hang on until as late as September Bank of Japan does not intend to ease credit policy further bank officials told They were responding to rumours in the Japanese bond market that the central bank was planning to cut its 25 pct discount rate soon possibly before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington on April 29 Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita will be in Osaka western Japan on April 27 and 28 for the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank making a rate cut announcement early next week a virtual impossibility they said April 29 is a holiday here Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Japan has no plans to take new emergency measures to support the dollar other than foreign exchange intervention He also told reporters that many major nations yesterday intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the countries involved and the amounts expended he said With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan might take new measures to support the US Currency such as curbing capital outflows Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 43 pct rise in US Gnp in the first quarter had been expected Although the growth looks robust on the surface the figures in reality are not that good he said He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring by a high-level advisory panel to Nakasone Miyazawa said it was important to put the panel's recommendations into effect strike by Japanese dockworkers will continue over the weekend as no breakthrough is in sight a Japan Harbour Transportation Association spokesman said The association has not yet agreed on a schedule for preliminary negotiations with the National Council of Harbour Workers Unions because the council insisted on talks with shippers as well as dock management he said The strike which began on Tuesday halted container movements to points inside Japan from the ports of Tokyo Yokohama Nagoya Osaka Kobe Kitakyushu Shimizu Yokkaichi and Hakata ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) drew up a final plan to expand domestic demand and boost imports in time for Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's visit to Washington next week LDP officials said The plan calls for additional fiscal measures worth more than 5000 billion yen a large-scale supplementary budget for the current fiscal year started April 1 and concentration of more than 80 pct of the annual public works budget in the first half of the year they said Nakasone will explain the measures to US Officials during his visit to Washington starting April 29 The LDP plan will be the basis for a government package of pump-priming measures expected to be unveiled in late May The LDP said Japan should do more to reduce its trade surplus Its plan is expected to help increase economic growth led by domestic demand officials said The government was also urged to review the ceiling on budgetary requests for investment purposes in 1988/89 The government has imposed a five pct cut in investment outlays in the past five years in line with Nakasone's avowed policy of fiscal reforms The plan called on Japan to promote government purchases of foreign goods and private sector imports of manufactured goods by improving import financing and to make clear official procurement procedures for foreign supercomputers The LDP also said Japan should contribute further to society at large through measures such as doubling its official development assistance to 76 billion dlrs in five years or so instead of seven years as the government had originally promised The government was urged to work out a program to recycle funds from Japan's trade surpluses to debt-ridden countries The officials said the funds to be recycled would include those from the private sector and others provided through the government Export-Import Bank of Japan and Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund The plan also calls for the government to take steps to help the development of African and other less developed nations The LDP called for adequate and flexible management of monetary policy such as a cut in interest rates on deposits with the Finance Ministry's Trust Fund and a tax cut to promote plant and equipment investment bank sources confirmed their banks have decided to leave the current 52 pct long-term prime rate unchanged The current rate has been in effect since March 28 The bankers said the rate was unchanged because the falling dollar and the bond market rally made it difficult to clarify the current level of yen interest rates There had earlier this week been expectations of a 02 point cut from today in response to the fall in the secondary market yield in five-year long-term bank debentures but bankers said last night the rate would be unchanged visit this week by a special Japanese envoy has done little to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States US and congressional leaders say White House and congressional leaders took a wait-and-see stance after a series of meetings with former Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe who was here paving the way for the April 29-May 2 visit of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone They are withholding judgment until Nakasone's visit with one senator saying Japan had promised to stimulate its economy and open its markets to foreign goods in the past but it was time now for action The US trade deficit last year was a record 1698 billion dlrs with more than one-third of it in trade with Japan Congress is ready to approve tough trade legislation to try to turn around the deficit which has cost millions of US jobs and closed thousands of factories Much of the anger has been directed at Japan US-Japan trade friction was further fueled by President Reagan's April 17 decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods in retaliation for unfair practices in semiconductor trade Reagan said he imposed the tariffs on personal computers television sets and hand tools because Japan failed to keep an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its home market to US products Abe had asked Reagan to end the tariffs quickly but US officials said the curbs would not be dropped until Japan had shown it was honoring the pact which could take several months White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater asked if Nakasone's visit might help to defuse trade tensions said whether progress can be made depends on how you want to measure it He added I would expect progress to be made If you want to measure that in terms of lifting the sanctions that's more doubtful Congressmen were equally skeptical Abe met Senate and Democratic leaders active in trade legislation telling them of Japan's plan to spur domestic spending by 34 billion dlrs and open its markets to a wide range of goods including supercomputers and farm products Sen John Danforth a Missouri Republican said after the meeting We have heard promises in the past but the question now is whether there will be real action Abe also met House leaders pressing for a tough trade bill including Congressman Richard Gephardt a Missouri Democrat Gephardt is sponsoring legislation to penalize nations with large deficits and which are guilty of unfair trade practices Gephardt's legislation would hit Japan as well as Taiwan South Korea and West Germany The bill is expected to pass the House next week - coinciding with Nakasone's visit - but its fate in the more moderate Senate is uncertain A bipartisan group of senators however told Nakasone in a letter released as Abe was holding Senate meetings that fresh Japanese-US trade strife would erupt if Japan's markets were not soon opened to American goods The signers included Democratic leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas and others ranging from moderate to hardline on trade issues They said in the letter there was growing US sentiment that Japan was fighting opening its markets and evidence to the contrary is necessary to combat this perception or it is likley that additional efforts will be attempted to close off the American market to Japanese goods Secretary James Baker said the Group of Seven leading industrial nations is fully committed to halting a further decline in the dollar Let me emphasize that all seven major industrial nations remain fully committed to strengthening policy coordination promoting growth and cooperating to foster stability of exchange rates he told the American Enterprise Institute We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be counter productive to our efforts (to promote growth) he said Baker also said that after meeting Japanese special envy Shintaro Abe it's clear that Japan intends to take strong steps to stimulate its economy to meet its committments under the Louvre Accord Baker said in the past two years he has worked to promote greater coordination of economic policies and important progress has been made Substantial exchange rate adjustments have also been accomplished over the past two years so that today we are better positioned to promote growth and reduce external imbalances he said Baker pointed out that in February the seven agreed to foster stable exchange rates and those commitments were renewed recently In a speech largely devoted to discussing trade and competitiveness Baker again warned of the dangers of protectionist trade legislation saying it would harm the US standard of living Baker stressed adminstration trade policy sought to remove foreign barriers to trade and via forthcoming GATT talks will focus on agriculture services and intellectual property The Treasury Secretary said that as well as trade issues he had to focus on macroeconomic issues as well which encompass the trade picture The world economy today is really one constantly flowing circle of capital and goods Trade accounts catch and measure that flow at only one spot on the circle he said crushers bought 5000 to 8000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for last-half May/first-half June shipment trade sources said Price details were not available of paper and lumber producers tumbled as a rumor spread that the Japanese may impose tariffs on wood and paper products analysts and industry officials said But they said logic and their own research do not support the rumors Apparently a rumor is floating around trading circles about the Japanese doing something about tariffs on wood and paper products Lowell Moholt director of investor relations at Weyerhaeuser Co said And we can only assume that this rumor is one of the factors hurting the stocks I have talked to many people some with government contacts and most of them have been mystified by the rumor said Moholt Nevertheless International Paper <IP> fell 4-3/8 to 95-1/2 Weyerhaeuser Co <WY> two to 51-1/2 Potlatch Corp <PCH> 3-1/2 to 69 Great Northern Nekoosa <GNN> 3-1/8 to 85-1/2 Temple Inland Inc <TIN> 2-3/4 to 57-1/4 Boise Cascade 2-3/8 to 74-3/8 Georgia Pacific Corp <GP> 1-1/2 to 43-3/4 Champion International Corp <CHA> 1-3/8 to 36-1/2 and Pope and Talbot Inc <POP> 1/2 to 36 My sources told me there is no grain of truth to the Japanese imposing tariffs Sherman Chao analyst with Salomon Inc said The realities and the logic do not support these rumors he said The Japanese have a lot more to lose by imposing tariffs They are running a trade surplus he said and if they started a trade war it would hurt them more than the US Chao said that US producers annually export about two billion dlrs of forest products to Japan Three quarters of that is in the form of wood products meaning logs wood chips and lumber and the balance is paper products They (the Japanese) don't have any domestic sources to make up for the restrictions Chao said so it's not like they would put a tariff to protect their own industry The rumors do no make economic sense and I am skeptical analyst Mark Rogers of Prudential Bache Securities said but politics has been known to override economic concerns Speculation has surfaced on Wall Street recently that the Japanese would take action to retaliate against tariffs the Reagan Administration imposed last Friday on Japanese electronics products Rogers said the rumor fueled the profit taking that was already occuring in these stocks In a nervous market people tend to take profits and they tend to take profits that have been the biggest gainers lately can look forward to fairly strong economic growth falling interest rates and firm Sterling Barclays Bank Plc chairman-elect John Quinton said We should see a reasonable decline in interest rates in the next few months but not a great one and not a rapid one Quinton told a press luncheon He said that whereas the British economy is growing at about three pct he expects only minor growth for the western industrialized world as a whole But unless there is a major move toward protectionism there should be no need to worry about a recession in the next two or three years Quinton said much will depend on the resolution of trade disputed between the United States and Japan He said Tokyo in resisting the appreciation of the yen had been holding back the laws of economics But if the dollar has to fall further to reduce Japan's trade surplus he said he hoped the fall would be slow rather than rapid Quinton said it will be difficult for the City of London to stave off the creation of a powerful securities industry regulatory body along the lines of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US especially if there are more insider trading scandals and if the Labour Party wins the next UK election Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was advised to work out a plan for his government to buy more than one billion dlrs worth of foreign industrial products as part of efforts to defuse Japan's trade frictions with the United States officials said Former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe made the recommendation at a meeting with Nakasone soon after returning from a US Visit designed to pave the way for the prime minister's visit to Washington starting next Wednesday Abe met President Ronald Reagan and US Congressional leaders during his visit It was not known how Nakasone responded to the suggestion It also included increasing the nation's untied loans to developing countries to between 25 billion and 30 billion dlrs over the next three years and giving foreign firms greater access to a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan officials said Abe called for tax cuts and government funds to be funneled into public works projects to stimulate domestic demand Abe spoke of the possibility that Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the US House of Representatives 1987 car export restraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq said There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are diverting cars to the EC after the dollars fall against the yen made their US Market unprofitable he told reporters after meeting US Japanese and Canadian trade ministers The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion in Japanese exports from the US To the EC market due to currency movements over the past two years it will move to prevent it he said Over the period the yen has risen against the dollar almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency Unit he said Japan has set an unofficial voluntary 10 pct rise in car exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its rising trade surplus with the Community which hit a record 18 billion dlrs last year But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in US Sales and a seven per cent fall globally We think there is some diversion there said de Clercq Japanese officials say the overall annual rise will be only 10 pct But even 10 pct is 100000 cars whereas we sell only 40000 cars to Japan (per year) in total he said The EC is also demanding that Japan ease its strict checks and requirements for imported cars which Brussels says is a non-tariff barrier The EC is also worried because EC demand for cars is falling this year making any rise in Japanese imports even more serious for EC auto manufacturers De Clercq who has taken a hard line on world trade problems at this weekend meeting in central Japan said the EC appreciated Japans plans to cut exports and lift domestic growth instead But even if all these measures are implemented it will take time But there is not time he said There are burning issues on the table which cannot wait It were better that the fire were put out immediately and not to wait till the house burns down he said from the major trading nations have for the first time made a concerted commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world farm trade Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said We think we can get some movement on this she told reporters at a briefing following informal talks with the US Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here Canada strongly supported by Australia has championed the cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war between the United States and the EC Japans protected agricultural markets have also attracted criticism The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farm sector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot compete with the subsidised US And EC products Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so) but many countries cannot said Carney She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which to discuss the issue Talks will now continue at the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) which meets next month and at the series of discussions on a new world trading framework begun at Punta del Este Uruguay last year Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role in the farm talks and that the United States was willing to see short-term progress as long as long-term solutions were not affected Canadas five point programme demands that farm product prices must reflect open world market prices that any support for farmers incomes should not be linked to production incentives that there should be no new farm subsidies no new farm import barriers and that any decisions should be implemented collectively The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have created some absurd situations For example to protect its farmers the Japanese government buys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price to Japanese consumers So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market to help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a profit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their farmers said Carney The problem causes pain for many nations and increases the already dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to US Japanese and EC banks York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the value of the dollar but refused to say whether US Interest rates would be raised to protect the currency A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen at this juncture I would regard as counterproductive he told a news conference His comments echoed those made last week by US Treasury Secretary James Baker who also warned against a further dollar fall The US Currency plunged to a post-war low below 140 yen last week despite dollar-buying by a number of central banks Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a further dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge US Trade deficit dealers said The only thing likely to help the dollar is seen as a rise in US Interest rates Corrigan refused to say whether the US Was ready to risk damaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates The dollars sharp drop this month has also raised questions about the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven But Corrigan said: They have played a constructive role in so far as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree of economic policy coordination trade ministers ended a weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action Until today we have anounced policies but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference From now on if a government comes up with a certain policy it must be followed by action he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States the European Community and Canada in central Japan Last week the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade We need credibility to gain confidence When we have confidence then we can have an impact said Tamura His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets The time has come now to act in step with the talk If you belong to a club you have to act in concord with the rules if you want to be credible said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed: We are meeting in a time of great trade tension What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face She said that next months meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results That is not the way it should be pursued he said What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way he said Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions he said Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential but currency movements alone would not correct a US Trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986 and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion he said Trade retaliation protectionism and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous he said The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal monetary trade and industrial measures and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules he said In this regard the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened he said The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) countries will meet next week to decide an agenda for the bodys June summit scheduled to be held in Venice Japanese officials said The meeting will provide senior government officials with their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the dollar although the main focus of the gathering is longer term they said Deputy Finance Ministers including Japanese Vice-Finance Minister Toyoo Gyohten will attend The meeting will be held in Italy they said but gave no other details The leaders of the G-7 the United States Britain Canada France Italy Japan and West Germany are expected to discuss ways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency markets But economists say the strategy has so far not worked Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can do on their own to stem the dollar decline which last week saw the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen The officials said they expected sentiment against the dollar to change soon once the US Trade deficit starts to fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the trade picture) but the market does not appreciate it yet one said Last weeks passage of the Japanese government budget by parliaments Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to take additional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boost imports the officials said from 46 countries are gathering for the 20th meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) amid concern over the banks role in aiding regional development The three-day meeting the first to be held in Japan since the banks inaugural meeting in Tokyo in 1966 will open tomorrow with political controversy dogging its heels Taiwan one of the ADBs founders will boycott the meeting for the second year in succession in protest against Chinas admission last year Taiwan which borrowed only 100 mln dlrs or 051 pct of the ADBs total lending of 194 billion dlrs over the past 20 years is staying away because its name was changed by the bank to Taipei China But the boycott is likely to be overshadowed by the presence of communist giants China and the Soviet Union Moscow is attending an ADB meeting for the first time in what is widely seen as a first step to eventual full membership China is expected to obtain its first loans from the bank in 1987 A senior ADB official said Peking now the banks third largest shareholder after the United States and Japan would also take one of the 12 seats on the banks board of governors The official who declined to be identified expected sparks to fly when governors met in formal session on Tuesday He said calls for expanded bank lending were expected from poorer countries in the Asia-Pacific region hit by plunging commodity prices tariff barriers in export markets a growing resources crunch and balance of payments crises But the US Delegation was likely to repeat warnings ADB lending should stress quality over quantity the official said The debate over ADB lending is fuelled by the banks highly successful money management With liquid reserves of about four billion dlrs profits have been rising steadily and touched 287 mln dlrs last year The key indicator of the ADBs reduced role in regional development is its net transfer of resources -- loan disbursements less repayments made by borrowers -- which fell sharply to 237 mln dlrs in 1986 from 421 mln in 1985 In 1986 the bank approved loans totalling two billion dlrs but only to 19 of its 29 developing members ADB chief economist Kedar Nath Kohli told the banks ordinary lending had declined each year since 1984 Im afraid if you exclude India and China its going to go down even further in 1987 Kohli said Kohli said developing countries in the region were entering a period of painful adjustments He said one country that seemed to be on the right track was South Korea which had bucked the regional trend of rising indebtedness by cutting its foreign debt by about two billion dlrs last year One country that has complained about the ADB's lending policies is Vietnam which charged at last year's meeting that the bank had cut off its aid on political grounds The bank abruptly halted loans to Hanoi after the fall of the Saigon government in 1975 Despite Moscow's presence however the bank is not expected to change its Vietnam policy The Philippines the ABD's second-largest borrower in 1986 with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs is happy with the bank's role Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin told he expected the figure would reach roughly the same level this year Bank of Japan intervened buying dollars shortly after the opening of 13770 yen dealers said Strong selling from life insurance companies and investment trusts pressured the dollar downward but the US Unit steadied on profit-taking buying by petroleum companies and intervention by the central bank The dollar's upward potential looks limited as forward dollar selling by exporters for commercial purposes is expected above 13780 dealers said Jiji Press quoted Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita as telling Japanese reporters the central bank will continue determined market intervention to prevent a further rise in the value of the yen Sumita who is attending an annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank also said he does not think the yen will continue to rise Jiji reported He said the Bank of Japan is keeping close contact with other major industrial nations on concerted market intervention Jiji said He said coordinated intervention is the only way to stop the dollar from dropping too fast Jiji said The dollar fell below 138 yen today Bundesbank intervened in the Tokyo foreign exchange market to buy a small amount of dollars against marks through the Bank of Japan dealers said The West German central bank bought dollars when the dollar was at about 17770-80 marks Dealers' estimates of the intervention amount varied from 100 mln to one billion dlrs Some dealers said the Bank of Japan appeared to have undertaken small-lot mark-selling intervention on its own account Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference the basic solution to currency instability among major nations is economic policy coordination He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination does not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage That is democracy he said Upon that foundation Miyazawa said there must be coordinated intervention Major nations have sufficient funds to continue concerted intervention he added Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will continue to operate Miyazawa said Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and US President Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre and Washington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currency stability when they meet later this week Asked whether the dollar is declining against all major currencies not only the yen Miyazawa declined to make any comments He reiterated that many major nations have undertaken coordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar including countries who are not members of the G-7 Soviet Union is attending an Asian Development Bank (ADB) annual general meeting for the first time but has not decided whether to apply for membership a senior Soviet State Bank official said No specific plans exist for applying for membership Yurij Ponomarev international managing director of the State Bank told It's too early to draw up any plans The USSR is attending the 20th meeting as an observer The sole purpose is to observe and collect information first hand Ponomarev said He said the Soviet Union was responding to a long-standing ADB invitation to attend the meetings This is one of the fastest growing regions in the world the State Bank official said It is in our interest to have good contacts But those strengthened contacts will not be made at the expense of the Soviet Union's other relationships he said Delegates here said the USSR move was connected to recent efforts to develop closer ties with Asia The policy was announced last year by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in a speech at Vladivostok Moscow's decision to attend the meetings follows its application last year for membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Delegates said the USSR faces lacklustre growth and is searching for ways to boost its economy Although the ADB said political ideology is not a critiera for membership several delegates said politics would play a large role in any decision to allow Moscow to join Moscow's application would have to be approved by two-thirds of the board of governors representing three-quarters of the total voting power of member countries The basic votes of the 47 members are all equal and total one-fifth of all votes The remainder are proportional to the number of shares held by each member Japan is the largest shareholder at 151 pct followed by the US With 149 pct and China with 72 pct The US Has more than 12 pct of the total votes insufficient to block a Moscow membership bid Japanese officials said Tokyo has not decided its position regarding the possibility of Soviet membership and said they noted the Soviets had not yet made any move to join Reagan is expected to tell Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone this week that the US May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June the New York Times said The newspaper quoting administration officials said that under such a scenario the President would announce just before the June 8-10 economic summit meeting in Venice that he hoped to lift the restrictions on electronics imports by the end of the month Japan for its part would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan for US Chip producers The US Administration

a meeting here yesterday The 14th yen aid package from Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund was also discussed Ongpin said the Japan is expected to respond favourably to a Philippine request to raise the aid level to between 75 and 80 billion yen The aid package originally scheduled for Japan's 1986/87 fiscal year ended March was delayed because of the Philippines' change of government last year The Japanese have indicated we may not get as much as we are asking for in one big jump from the 13th yen package of 49 billion yen he said But they are likely to bring it up to that level for the 15th package Ongpin said Manila had 14 projects in the pipeline for the 14th yen package We are trying get the 15th package mainly in the form of untied commodity loans he said Discussion on a Philippine request for 500 mln dlrs in soft loans to finance a land reform program for which Japan is expected to supply most of the financing had been put off until next month because of delays in preparatory work Ongpin said he will make a strong pitch for the land reform program in his speech on Tuesday at the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) here Ongpin said the Philippines is very happy about the ADB's support after President Corazon Aquino took over from deposed leader Ferdinand Marcos But I would like to see them push more aggressively in the field of lending to the private sector he said The Philippines was the bank's second-biggest borrower after Pakistan in 1986 with loans totalling 316 mln dlrs Ongpin said he expects ADB lending to the Philippines in 1987 to reach the same level They have told us they can lend us two billion dlrs if we want But we have to come up with the projects he said Japanese trading companies and one coin

of the Indian delegation at the ADB's annual meeting here told the bank is likely to approve three loans totalling between 350 and 400 mln dlrs in 1987 up from the 250 mln in two loans in 1986 The official said negotiations on a 100 mln dlr loan for the modernisation of the Haldia and Madras ports had been completed and only need approval by the bank's board The official said an ADB team is now in India for a survey of the second project involving imports of railway locomotives He said the bank was also likely to extend a credit line to the Industrial Development Bank of India The ADB in 1986 extended a 100 mln dlr line of credit to state-owned Industrial Finance Corp of India The official said the ADB wants to gradually expand lending to India They (the bank) do not want their traditional borrowers from smaller countries in the region to get overwhelmed by (India and China) he said China is expected to receive its first ADB loan this year We are quite satisfied at having opened this new window in borrowing the official said Our projects are being vetted quickly We have no complaints He said the ADB in any case would not be able to match Indian borrowing needs In fiscal 1986/87 ending June India will borrow two billion dlrs from the World Bank alone he said That represents the total ADB lending to all its borrowers in 1986 The official said total Indian development assistance from multilateral and bilateral creditors is likely to total four billion dlrs in 1986/87 Asked to comment on US Criticism of the quality of ADB lending the official said: The ADB is a regional bank and ought to have a better understanding of realities in Asia You cannot apply World Bank conditionalities everywhere he said The US Cannot impose one yardstick for every country Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a parliamentary Upper House budget committee that he does not think the dollar is in a freefall He said concerted intervention is only a supplementary measure to moderate volatility in exchange rates and repeated that policy coordination among major industrial nations is necessary We cannot expect currency stability only through coordinated market intervention he said Miyazawa also told the committee the US Has not called on Japan to cut its 25 pct discount rate Miyazawa said the government is not considering investing in US Government bonds to help stabilize exchange rates This matter has to be dealt with carefully because it involves the public's money and exchange rates are moving widely he added The ministry will consider where to invest its funds when exchange rates become stable he said Asked if Japan is considering a request to the US For it to raise its discount rate to stabilize exchange rates Miyazawa said the US Has not been able to take action now because it has to maintain its economic growth Bank of Japan's deputy governor Yasushi Mieno told a parliamentary Upper House budget committee that the central bank has no monetary measures other than intervention planned to stabilize currency rates He also said the Bank of Japan is not considering a cut in its 25 pct discount rate Mieno said the central bank is determined to restore currency stability through intervention by the major industrial nations as recent exchange rate volatility stems from speculation Economic fundamentals have not changed he added Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige said he hopes Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will make specific proposals to ease US-Japan trade friction at a meeting with President Reagan this week He also told reporters he hopes the US Will soon be able to lift sanctions imposed against Japan for alleged violations of an accord on semiconductors We have been very specific about our trade problems he told a news conference during a stopover in Hong Kong I hope (Nakasone) brings some specific answers to the trade problems We want to lift the sanctions as soon as possible Baldrige said He said that once the US Determines that Japan is selling semiconductors at cost it will be able to lift the 300 mln US Dlrs of duties it imposed on Japanese electronics goods on April 17 We have not seen that yet he said adding that it would take about one month to determine whether the alleged violations of a bilateral semiconductor pact had been discontinued Baldrige did not say what specific solutions he wanted for US-Japan trade problems But the New York Times today quoted administration sources as saying that the US May be able to lift trade sanctions against Japan by the end of June Japan would have to show that it had stopped underpricing semiconductors and had widened access in Japan top US Chip producers Baldrige also said that despite the current trade rift the US And Japan have long had friendly ties that neither side wants to change We have a very special relationship with Japan Japan is a friend and our ally Baldrige said Neither one of us wants that to change He also repeated statements that he did not foresee a trade war with Japan but that the US Had no choice but to impose the trade sanctions Corp <TSBAT> will set up a five-year technology partnership with California-based SDA Systems Inc with the intention of designing and producing computer microchips a company spokesman said Toshiba's investment in the project is likely to total less than 10 mln dlrs over the five years he said Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said he hopes his visit to Washington later this week will help resolve Japan's severe trade problems with the United States Nakasone leaves on his sixth official visit to the United States on Wednesday only weeks after President Reagan imposed punitive tariffs of 300 mln dlrs a year on Japanese electronic goods for alleged violation of a semiconductor pact Japan also faces more possible sanctions amid calls in the US Congress for further action to help improve trade imbalances Japan's trade surplus with the United States reached a record 586 billion dlrs in 1986 Nakasone told reporters that special envoy Shintaro Abe who has just returned from Washington told him protectionist sentiment in the United States is severe We are well aware of a movement in the United States to enact legislation Nakasone said He said friends at home and abroad have advised him not to go to the United States but it is now more important than ever that he express Japan's view and carefully listens to the views of the United States My visit to the United States at this time will be the most important visit of all Nakasone said While in Washington he said he hopes to have candid and frank discussions with President Reagan and Congressionl leaders He said he plans to discuss exchange rate stability economic cooperation to developing countries and US-Soviet disarmament and arms control On the recently imposed trade sactions Nakasone said he would present evidence that Japanese semiconductor imports are increasing and that Japan is monitoring exports to third countries We have full confidence we can present clear evidence he said (Therefore) we will request that the sanctions be lifted at the earliest possible time On the trade imbalance Nakasone said Japan has already taken action The volume of exports to the United States has been cut while US Imports have increased But Japanese imports from Europe and other Asian nations have recently surged those from the United States remain weak indicating a lack of US Competitiveness he said Nakasone said Japan will continue to strive to improve the trade imbalance but the United States will have to become more competitive and improve its huge budget deficit He said he will also discuss the forthcoming Venice summit of the seven major industrial nations in June We can further enhance the efforts for improving peace disarmament and the world economies as a whole through solidarity Nakasone said Bank of Japan will sell 600 billion yen in 60-day financing bills tomorrow through 36-day repurchase agreements maturing June 3 to roll over a previously issued 400 billion yen of such bills maturing tomorrow money traders said The yield on the bills for sale to banks and securities houses by money houses will be 38498 pct compared with the one-month commercial bill discount rate today of 38125 pct and the one-month certificate of deposit rate of 418/07 pct The traders estimate the surplus tomorrow at about 700 billion yen The remaining 300 billion yen is mainly due to increased cash holdings by the banking system because of central bank dollar purchases The operation will put the outstanding supply of such bills to 3500 billion yen Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa opened the 20th annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank by holding out the promise of more Japanese money for the organisation We are  Striving to enhance the flow of capital from Japan to the developing countries he said The Asia-Pacific region is an area of special concern for us in our bilateral and multilateral assistance He said Tokyo was ready to study setting up a special Japanese fund at the ADB like the one at the World Bank The World Bank fund is earmarked for use by developing countries Developing countries and the United States have criticised Japan for failing to use its trade surplus to help poor countries Later this week Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone is expected to tell President Reagan that Japan plans to extend as much as 30 billion dlrs to developing countries over the next three years Japanese officials said The exta ADB funding would be part of that amount Our cooperation is intended to contibute to  Alleviating the burden on (developing countries) said Miyazawa who is also chairman of the ADB board of governors The developing countries today find themselves in a very difficult situation he said With a few notable exceptions those countries that are highly dependent upon commodity exports face a rough road ahead While the developing countries can help themselves by striving to become internationally competitive and seeking to attract foreign investment the ADB also has a role to play he said Miyazawa told the meeting the bank must beef up its economic advice program to developing nations and must work vigorously to identify development projects for loans He also called for more use of loans that were not tied to development projects but provided more overall help to the borrower ADB President Masao Fujioka supported Miyazawa's view The bank has been fondly described as the family doctor Fujioka said The bank will now have to equip itself to meet a range of services required to attend to varied needs of its developing members Miyazawa told the meeting Tokyo was ready to allow its Export-Import Bank to co-finance ADB loans These would not have to be used for the purchase of Japanese equipment Tokyo was also prepared to let the Asian Development Bank raise more funds in Tokyo and financial markets should it need to do so he said Steel Corp <NSTCT> nominated Hiroshi Saito as president to replace Yutaka Takeda subject to shareholders' approval at a meeting on June 26 company officials told a press conference Takeda will become chairman and vice president Akira Miki will be vice chairman they said Current chairman Eishiro Saito who is also chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) a leading Japanese business organisation will act as honorary chairman and advisor they added Nippon Steel is now undergoing a strict rationalisation program to meet declining demand for steel products United States and Japan are waging a behind the scenes battle at this week's Asian Development Bank meeting over Tokyo's attempts to win a greater say in the organization US And Japanese delegates said Washington is opposing the Japanese efforts because it would mean the end of the long-standing parity between the two nations in the Bank US Officials said Right now the two countries' voting shares are about equal Japan having 1253 pct and the United States 1236 pct The slight difference is due to a temporary delay in the US Subscription to the Bank It's quite a delicate matter Japanese Finance Ministry deputy director general Fumiya Iwasaki told I don't see the discussion ending soon The issue is further complicated because other member nations would have to give up some of their power in the Bank if Japan were to increase its influence he said Tokyo raised the issue at last year's annual meeting in Manila arguing that the 37 billion dlrs it has contributed to the Bank's soft loans fund entitled it to a greater say in the overall organization The United States has given 12 billion dlrs to the Asian Development Fund Bank of Japan

intervention by the major industrial nations as recent exchange rate volatility stems from speculation Economic fundamentals have not changed he added York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the value of the dollar but refused to say whether US interest rates would be raised to protect the currency A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen at this juncture I would regard as counterproductive he told a news conference His comments echoed those made last week by US Treasury Secretary James Baker who also warned against a further dollar fall Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a further dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge US trade deficit dealers said adding the only thing likely to help the dollar is seen as a rise in US Interest rates Corrigan refused to say whether the US was ready to risk damaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates The dollar's sharp drop this month has also raised questions about the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven But Corrigan said: They have played a constructive role in so far as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree of economic policy coordination Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference the basic solution to currency instability among major nations is economic policy coordination He said that is a time-consuming process as coordination does not always proceed in a way policy makers envisage That is democracy he said Upon that foundation Miyazawa said there must be coordinated intervention Major nations have sufficient funds to continue concerted intervention he added Without doubt this set-up of coordinated intervention will continue to operate Miyazawa said Miyazawa said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and US President Ronald Reagan are likely to reaffirm the Louvre and Washington Group of Seven (G-7) agreements on currency stability when they meet later this week Asked whether the dollar is declining against all major currencies not only the yen Miyazawa declined to make any comments He reiterated that many major nations have undertaken coordinated intervention in recent weeks to prop up the dollar including countries who are not members of the G-7 Philippines has received a 300 mln dlr loan from the Japanese Export-Import Bank Philippine Finance Minister Jaime

partners that its trade deficit must fall by September or a protectionist trade bill from Congress would be highly likely Meanwhile European Community (EC) external trade chief Willy de Clercq said that if Japan's trade surplus which hit almost 90 billion dlrs last year continued so high there would be stormy weather ahead US Trade representative Clayton Yeutter told trade leaders from Japan the EC and Canada that there was at least a 50-50 chance that a protectionist bill reaching the House of Representatives this week would pass the Senate in September The US economy badly needed better trade figures by then or President Ronald Reagan would have a difficult time vetoing such a bill he said according to a series of briefings to reporters by official delegates at the weekend meeting A 15 billion dlr US Trade deficit in March had only incensed Congress further he said 1987 car export restraint to the European Community (EC) is not enough EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq said There are also strong signs Japanese exporters are diverting cars to the EC after the dollar's fall against the yen made their US market unprofitable he told reporters after meeting US Japanese and Canadian trade ministers The EC has agreed that if it detects an abnormal diversion in Japanese exports from the US To the EC market due to currency movements over the past two years it will move to prevent it he said Over the period the yen has risen against the dollar almost eight times as fast as against the European Currency Unit he said Japan has set an unofficial voluntary 10 pct rise in car exports to the EC this year as part of its efforts to stop its rising trade surplus with the Community which hit a record 18 billion dlrs last year But Japanese car exports to the EC so far this year jumped over 30 pct compared to a drop of 17 pct in US Sales and a seven per cent fall globally We think there is some diversion there said de Clercq officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) countries will meet next week to decide an agenda for the body's June summit scheduled to be held in Venice Japanese officials said The meeting will provide senior government officials with their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the dollar although the main focus of the gathering is longer term they said Deputy Finance Ministers including Japanese Vice-Finance Minister Toyoo Gyohten will attend The meeting will be held in Italy they said but gave no other details The leaders of the G-7 the United States Britain Canada France Italy Japan and West Germany are expected to discuss ways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency markets But economists say the strategy has so far not worked Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can do on their own to stem the dollar decline which last week saw the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen The officials said they expected sentiment against the dollar to change soon once the US Trade deficit starts to fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the trade picture) but the market does not appreciate it yet one said Last week's passage of the Japanese government budget by parliament's Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to take additional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boost imports the officials said Japanese trading companies and one coin retailer will start selling Australia's Nugget gold coins in Japan from May 12 after actively buying at the first international trading of the coins last Thursday officials involved in the sale said They estimated Japanese companies bought 30 pct of 155000 ounces sold on Thursday The coins are likely to be sold in Japan at prices similar to the South African krugerrand Minister Manuel Azpurua said today he will travel to Japan in mid-May to seek new credits for planned expansions in Venezuela's state aluminum steel and petrochemical industries Azpurua told reporters he will be accompanied by Central Bank President Hernan Anzola and Director of Public Finance Jorge Marcano 'The idea is to hold meetings with Japanese economic and financial authorities with the banks which have business and credits in Venezuela and with some of the Japanese companies already active here' Azpurua said Secretary James Baker has cancelled a trip to Australia because of pressing business at home including the visit this week by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone a Treasury spokesman said The spokesman who asked not to be identified said: I would not draw any conclusion from the cancellationI would just say it's the press of business But he added that the visit by the Japanese leader was part of the press of business The spokesman denied the cancellation was linked to the current turmoil in the financial markets Nakasone's visit is expected to be crucial for the currency markets Unless the Japanese prime minister brings with him measures to stimulate the Japanese economy by fiscal expansion or lower interest rates the visit is likely to be considered by currency markets as an outright failure In addition it is thought highly unlikely that Nakasone and Reagan will agree on the removal of US trade sanctions imposed earlier this month on certain electronic goods But the participation in the talks by Baker the administration's top policy maker on international economic affairs suggests that hard bargaining between the two sides may be in prospect Asked if the trip by Baker who was to have left April 30 and returned May 6 had been dropped in the last couple of days the Treasury spokesman replied: I would think so He described the trip as purely ceremonial Both Japan and the United States have a lot to lose from an unsuccessful outcome to the this week's talks Tokyo and Washington are aware that nervous currency markets stand ready to bail out of dollars and buy yen which economists fear could send world interest rates soaring and even lead to global recession Baker has been the driving force behind the administration's efforts to coordinate international economic policies and reduce global trade imbalances 22nd annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank will be held in Peking in 1989 a senior bank official told China which was admitted as the bank's 47th member in March 1986 will take a place on the ADB board at the current meeting here he said Peking's representatives have been

agree on the Canadian coal base price over four years from April 1 but agreed to have another round of talks in late May officials involved said Japanese firms have asked for the base price to be set at 44 US Dlrs per tonne (FOB) sharply lower than the 75 to 76 dlrs of the past four years they told The base price is reviewed every four years under the long-term accord The Canadian mine insisted on maintaining the present price they said Japanese firms bought 475 mln tonnes of Quintette coal in 1986/87 and plan to buy the same volume in 1987/88 depending on the result of the talks the officials said They added Japan has no plans to withdraw its price cutback request due to recent falls in coking coal prices on the world market Meanwhile <Gregg River Co> of Canada has agreed on a Japanese proposal to set a temporary price of 7580 Canadian dlrs on and after May shipment following the failure of the 1987/88 price talks they said Japanese firms plan to buy 150000 tonnes of Gregg River

Wednesday Abe met President Ronald Reagan and US Congressional leaders during his visit It was not known how Nakasone responded to the suggestion It also included increasing the nation's untied loans to developing countries to between 25 billion and 30 billion dlrs over the next three years and giving foreign firms greater access to a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan officials said Abe called for tax cuts and government funds to be funneled into public works projects to stimulate domestic demand Abe spoke of the possibility that Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the US House of Representatives Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone beleaguered by political turmoil at home sets out Wednesday on a tough mission to Washington aimed at defusing the most serious US-Japanese trade tension in recent memory Two rounds of talks between President Reagan and Nakasone scheduled for Thursday and Friday come on the heels of the imposition by the United States of punitive tariffs on Japanese goods for the first time since World War Two In the past bilateral trade friction involving cotton goods steel television sets textiles and cars have ended with Japan taking on voluntary export curbs Nakasone's visit could coincide with the passage of a protectionist trade bill by the US House of Representatives A proposed amendment to the bill drafted by Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri will mandate a 10 pct annual reduction in the trade surpluses of Japan and other nations which have large trade gaps with the United States The United States last year had a record trade deficit of 1698 billion dlrs and Japan accounted for about one-third Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda said recently he was reasonably optimistic about the results of talks between the two leaders Top US and Japanese officials have shuttled back and forth across the Pacific to lay the groundwork for Nakasone's visit The last of the talks leading up to the main event will be in Washington next Wednesday between US Secretary of State George Shultz and Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari Nakasone will have an economic package worked out by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and by an advisory body led by former Bank of Japan Governor Haruo Maekawa Japan plans to spend over 5000 billion yen to boost domestic demand increase imports of US products including supercomputers and give more help to developing countries government officials said The government has been making last ditch efforts in time for Nakasone's trip to address outstanding bilateral issues officials said The issues include foreign access to a new Japanese overseas telecommunications venture and a six billion dlr international airport project in western Japan Nakasone and his party last week reached a compromise accord with opposition parties over a controversial sales tax plan in exchange for parliamentary passage by the Lower House of a government draft budget for 1987/88 The accord offered by House Speaker Kenzaburo Hara virtually killed the Nakasone-sponsored plan but left room for future tax reform plans political analysts said Nakasone who led his party to a resounding electoral triumph last July saw his popularity drop because of the sales tax His party suffered setbacks in an Upper House by-election and nationwide local elections in the past two months Mitsuru Uchida professor of political science at Waseda University told I doubt that whatever Nakasone does in Washington -- no matter how good it might be -- would help restore his weakened power-base at home Many analysts said Nakasone might step down after the Venice summit of industrialized nations in June trade ministers ended a weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action Until today we have anounced policies but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference From now on if a government comes up with a certain policy it must be followed by action he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States the European Community and Canada in central Japan Last week the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade We need credibility to gain confidence When we have confidence then we can have an impact said Tamura His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets The time has come now to act in step with the talk If you belong to a club you have to act in concord with the rules if you want to be credible said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq Pat Carney of Canada said We are meeting in a time of great trade tension What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results That is not the way it should be pursued he said What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way he said Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others' positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions he said Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential but currency movements alone would not correct a US trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986 and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion he said Trade retaliation protectionism and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous he said The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal monetary trade and industrial measures and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules he said In this regard the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened he said The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy Reagan said he hoped the United States could lift trade sanctions against Japan soon But he said the United States would do what is necessary to see that other nations lived up to their trade agreements In a speech prepared for delivery to the US Chamber of Commerce he said I hope that before long we can lift these (Japanese trade sanctions) and that this episode will be recorded as a small incident in the building of our relationship But Reagan added we will do what is necessary to see that other nations live up to their obligations and trading agreements with us Trade must be free It must also be fair Reagan said the decision to impose 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of electronic exports to the United States sent a message it was time to complete a US-Japan trade bridge The final answer to the trade problems between America and Japan is not more hemming and hawing not more trade sanctions not more voluntary restraint agreements - though these may be needed as steps along the way - and certainly not more unfulfilled agreements he said Reagan said the answer was genuinely fair and open markets on both sides of the Pacific - and the sooner the better Reagan said the administration's tools for dealing with unfair trade practices met the need for both firmness and finesse He said trade legislation pending in Congress would be dangerous because it would force the administration to use a steamroller against unfair practices every time no matter whether the steamroller would open the trade doors or flatten the entire house he said Reagan said that ending every unfair trade practice in Japan would cut the US trade deficit by only about 10 pct If our trade deficit is to come down more must be done -- and is being done he said The change in the dollar's value is part of it and since the middle of last year the actual volume of our exports had been on the rise he said He also said he believed America's trading partners should cut taxes and regulations as the United States had done so that they could create jobs and buy more goods Reagan administration is expected to face tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched US interests if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beef and citrus import controls by April 1988 US and Japanese officials said Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus in talks here last week insisting that the quotas be abandoned by April 1988 But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japan will resist the pressure fiercely and because some US suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintaining the quotas US and Japanese officials told Twice in the past the United States has negotiated with Japan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978 and in bilateral talks in 1984 Each time the US demanded an end to the quotas at the outset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead The current agreement calls for an increase in high quality beef imports to 58400 tonnes in fiscal 1987 oranges to 126000 tonnes and orange juice to 8500 tonnes Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United States will not settle for simple increases in the quotas Japan has been given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support system and the quotas must be scrapped Lyng said Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and citrus in August or September in Hawaii sources said If the US intends to press its tough stance and Japan as expected rejects the demands the issue may then be put to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April 1988 deadline set by the US officials said In interviews here Japanese officials insist that on beef they will not liberalize imports regardless of the US pressure because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive and would be damaged by freer trade Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small farms which Japanese officials said must be protected from cheap imports by use of the quota system Furthermore while the US National Cattlemen's Association is strongly supporting the tough administration position some US meat exporters and packers are ambivalent This is because to some US exporters and packers beef exports to Japan under the quota system are a steady reliable business managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation Under quotas the US share of Japan's beef market has expanded at the expense of Australia In the absence of quotas some US suppliers are concerned the US share might decline and exporting to Japan would become a riskier business meat industry sources said Major US meat industry leaders will meet in Washington next week including cattlemen processors and exporters in an effort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue California's Sunkist the largest US supplier of oranges to Japan has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is concerned that in the absence of quotas lower quality oranges from Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan Ironically some Japanese officials hinted that fresh oranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a minimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production This is because US oranges do not directly compete with smaller Japanese mandarins officials said But Japan wants to maintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juice tastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orange juice they said One scenario mentioned by both US and Japanese officials is that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stance by offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return for US acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef and citrus imports is a difficult objective but he insisted during the week-long tour here that it is a high priority on the US/Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the rice issue which received most of the attention Asked about the ambivalence of some in US agribusiness Lyng noted some interests on both the US and Japanese side have benefited from quotas but this will not stop the administration from pressing for liberalization And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshall more support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before because of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation) with a much stronger view coming out of Washington The times have changed The trade balance is much worse Lyng said Kong has not taken unfair advantage of its currency's link with the US Dollar Hong Kong monetary affairs secretary David Nendick told the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank here He said: We have taken the rough with the smooth having to accept a downward adjustment of our economy in 1985 following a period when the US Dollar was clearly overvalued in world terms but benefiting as that currency subsequently declined He said that since the establishment of the link in 1983 Hong Kong's trade had been broadly in balance This year a modest deficit was expected Under the link Hong Kong's entirely free and open economy continues to adjust quickly to any external imbalances but the burden of adjustment now falls almost entirely on our domestic interest rates money supply and price levels Nendick said The relative volatility in these domestic variables is the price we pay for the stability of our currency against the US Dollar he said Asian Development Bank (ADB) today wound up a three-day meeting which was marked by criticism of the ADB from both rich and poor member nations In speech after speech the 20-year-old ADB was charged either with not doing enough to help countries in the region or with funding projects which were not worthwhile The attacks often but not always broke down along developed and developing country lines The former which provide the ADB with money generally emphasized the need for quality projects The ADB was not even spared criticism from its host country and largest shareholder Japan I am not 100 pct satisfied with the performance of the ADB Japanese finance ministry deputy director-general Fumiya Iwasaki told He said the Bank had only approved five pct more new loans in 1986 than in 1985 He hoped for a return to the more rapid growth rates of earlier years The Asian economy is now changing The ADB should adapt itself to those changes he said But supporters of the ADB said it already was changing and Iwasaki made it clear Japan welcomed the steps being taken by the ADB's president Masao Fujioka So far we have confidence in Mr Fujioka's leadership Iwasaki said To spur demand for loans the ADB has restructured its country and agricultural departments to enable it to identify the needs of developing member countries more quickly But some delegates said the ADB was putting too much emphasis on the need to give out more money and not enough on checking the quality of the projects involved The success of the Bank should not be measured by the volume of its lending but by its contribution to the development process chief US Delegate Charles H Dallara told the meeting He said: Project quality is an area which has attracted attention recently and on which the United States has expressed strong views Although over the years the majority of ADB loans have been sound we have had problems with some of the projects brought before the board of directors lately Australia voiced similar concerns Australian delegate C J Hurford said: Bad projects benefit neither the Bank nor its borrowers They damage the Bank's reputation and ultimately lessen support from donor countries and capital markets There were also criticisms of proposals from developing countries that the ADB make more of its loans dependent on economic reforms in Third World nations We are concerned with the Bank's increasing preoccupation with dialogue said India's delegate S Venkitaramanan We have expressed our unhappiness with the insistence of multi-lateral agencies on global prescriptions he said is likely to borrow up to 300 mln dlrs this year from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) president Masao Fujioka said The loans would be China's first from the ADB I think there will be at least one loan to China this year and possibly a second Fujioka told a news conference at the end of the ADB's annual meeting here Asked how large the loans were likely to be Fujioka said he thought they would range from 100 mln to 150 mln dlrs each China is the ADB's newest member joining in March 1986 China is the third-largest shareholder after Japan and the US It was elected to the ADB's 12-member board yesterday Fujioka announced that the ADB's 1989 meeting would be held in Peking The 1988 meeting will be held in Manila Fujioka said the ADB would consider delegates' suggestions that it set up a task force of experts to define its future role The ADB's performance was criticised by both its rich and poor members at the three-day meeting just finished External experts had carried out a study on ADB policy for the 1980s Fujioka said He said a similar study for the 1990s would be useful but the ADB had no fixed ideas yet He said the ADB had already responded to members like the US Which urged it to improve analysis of funded projects We had already decided that the ADB should strengthen its research capability Fujioka said He said ADB lending had declined but the amount is not the only thing that counts We also want to be a catalyst by taking innovative measures like the promotion of the private sector Fujioka also talked of the struggle between the US And Japan over their voting power in the ADB Total Japanese contributions to the ADB are higher than those of the US So Japanese delegates asked for their voting power to reflect this The US Opposed the move It is advisable and wise for institutions like the ADB to be viable that there be a reasonable relationship between financial contributions and voting power Fujioka said But he indicated the problem remained unresolved Asked if the ADB would respond to a plea by Vietnam to resume lending which was cut off in 1974 Fujioka re-iterated his view that conditions there were not conducive to banking Fujioka declined to elaborate on Vietnam but said there had been no pressure from the US Or any other country on the issue He also spoke about demands by the bank's financiers that it take a more active role in prodding borrowers into making economic policy changes The initiative must come from the borrowing country We don't accept that we impose policy conditions There must be a two-way consultation he said Soviet Union's first official observer at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said he came away from this week's ADB annual meeting with a favourable impression but that no decision has been made on whether the Soviet Union should join as a full member Yurij V Ponomarev international managing director of the State Bank said he will file a formal report when he returns to Moscow but it will not contain any recommendation on membership We haven't started any process with a view toward membership he said Ponomarev downplayed the significance of his attendance saying it only signalled a slight change in attitude by Moscow Although this is the first time Moscow has attended the ADB's annual meeting as an observer Soviet bankers have come to meetings in the past as guests he said Delegates here saw the Soviet move as part of an overall strategy to strengthen ties with Asia and improve the functioning of the Soviet economy Ponomarev declined to comment on remarks yesterday by a senior US Official who warned that Soviet membership in the ADB would cause serious operational problems How would the ADB for instance use the (Soviet) rouble as a basis for expanding its capital? asked the US Official who declined to be identified Ponomarev said: It is far too premature to speculate on the potential difficulties that might be involved if we applied for membership In order to become a member Moscow would have to gain the backing of two-thirds of the board of governors representing three-quarters of the voting power of member countries Washington has just over a 12 pct voting share views with concern a plan to increase Japan's voting power at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) a US Delegate at the bank's annual meeting said Japan which holds 151 pct of the ADB's capital stock and the US Which holds 149 pct currently have near-parity in voting power The ADB was set up in 1966 as a partnership between the US And Japan the official said Any change in that relationship would transmit a psychological message to this region's countries that there is a slackening of interest on the part of the US We do not want any dilution of our influence in the organisation the US Official added He said an imbalance in procurement contracts awarded for ADB-funded projects was however improving slowly The US Share of the contracts had grown from about seven pct to about 12 pct in 1986 the official said while Japan's share had dropped from 25 pct to 20 pct We will urge more US Businessmen to join in the bidding for these projects he said The official said Washington was concerned about the ADB's future role in the region The US Believes the ADB should act as a catalyst both for policy changes that will lead to sustainable long-term economic growth and for other financial flows chief US Delegate Charles Dallara told the meeting earlier Economic reform should be a theme of the ADB's lending the unidentified US Official said The bank is doing its borrowers a disservice by not entering into policy dialogue he added We are looking for the bank to take up the cudgel when its borrowers are at a critical stage in their development We are looking at a 15 or 20 year horizon Securities Co Ltd of Tokyo plans to open a new Canadian company after a June 30 deregulation of the Ontario equity market is implemented Daiwa Securities general manager for Canada Hajimu Watanabe told in reply to query The Toronto Stock Exchange earlier announced Daiwa became the first Japanese company to acquire an exchange seat paying 361000 Canadian dlrs the highest price ever paid This is a prelude of our establishment of a new Canadian company Watanabe said Watanabe said Daiwa's new Canadian brokerage house will concentrate on investment in Canadian stocks by Japanese investors Canadians acquiring Japanese equity and government and corporate financing mainly in the Canadian bond market We have now a huge amount of demand on the part of Japanese investors for Canadian stocks Watanabe said So if we can get membership of the Toronto Stock Exchange that should support our business very much he added Daiwa's application for exchange membership is subject to approval by other members and the Ontario Securities Commission When asked Watanabe declined to specify how much capital Daiwa the world's second largest investment dealer would invest in its Canadian subsidiary It is quite confidential at this moment but say our main intention is not to create any friction with the Canadian houses Watanabe said He said Daiwa could easily set up its new unit with one billion Canadian dlrs of capital but we are starting at quite a moderate figure But small means quite big in Canadian terms he added Daiwa which established a representative office in Canada in 1980 is ready to open its Canadian house as soon as Ontario security deregulation is implemented on June 30 Watanabe said adding Daiwa is very pleased with its reception by Canadian regulatory authorities Watanabe said about 10 pct of Japanese investment in foreign securities goes to Canada ranking second to the United States which receives about 50 pct The Japanese institutional investors feel that it is rather risky to concentrate around the 50 pct in one country he said Japanese institutional investors are trying to diversify to other non-American vehicles and there are very few candidates that remain safe investment objects Daiwa's Watanabe added Investors in Japan are also feeling it is risky to concentrate in fixed income paper and are looking more towards investment in paper equity and real estate So investment in Canadian paper especially Canadian equity should have a great future Watanabe said Mining Co Ltd president Yukio Kasahara said the state-owned Japanese firm hoped to find additional joint venture partners to explore for US oil reserves We have to secure the stability of oil for Japan Kasahara told reporters at the World Petroleum Congress In the exploration area I think Japanese companies are interested in joint ventures Nippon Mining for example last September signed an agreement with Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc to participate in a 135 mln dlr exploration venture that includes six wells on land and 14 offshore Louisiana The first joint well drilled is in the Gulf of Mexico's Green Canyon Block 182 a deepwater lease that Conoco was almost forced to return to the federal government undrilled because of low oil prices At this moment we have no success but we will proceed with Conoco Maybe by the end of the year we will find oil there Kasahara said He said that similar kinds of joint ventures would be best for Nippon Mining's oil exploration efforts in the future Kasahara also said Nippon Mining was not planning to acquire any US refining or marketing outlets Retail sales in general do not interest the Japanese oil companies he said When asked whether he believed world oil prices might strengthen later this year Kasahara said he expected prices to hold steady at today's level Within this year I think the 18 dlrs a barrel will continue But next year I don't know he said For the refining business stability is important Whether the price is 18 dlrs or 20 dlrs we don't care But encouraging additional upstream efforts may require modestly higher oil prices Kasahara added For exploration I think 20 dlrs a barrel or 22 dlrs a barrel would be reasonable he said The key factor in determining whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would raise its 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price is the ongoing war between Iran and Iraq Kasahara said Saudi Arabia he added was an uncertain element in the OPEC equation because of its need to maintain revenues at the same time the weakened US dollar has reduced oil profits Nippon Mining which like all Japanese crude buyers is benefitting from the drop in the value of the dollar favors continuing to price OPEC crude oil according to US currency regardless of the dollar-yen relationship Kasahara said I hope the dollar would strengthen eventually and continue to improve I would prefer to see the (OPEC) pricing remain in dollars he said offering variable life insurance policies introduced in Japan in October look set to report sparkling results when they report on fund performance later this month fund managers at major insurance companies said The managers told some insurers showed variable life returns topping 50 pct on an annual basis in the five months to March 31 Industry sources said all 17 Japanese and US Insurers offering variable life policies here have earned returns of more than 10 pct on their investments Returns on variable life policies which are paid when policies are surrendered depend on the performance of funds run by insurers Managers said strong results are due to the loading of funds into the buoyant Tokyo stock market and into convertible bonds and attractive short-term instruments such as large yen time deposits Japanese share prices rose 30 pct in absolute terms between November 1 and March 31 Key bond yields fell to around four pct from five pct in the same period Variable life avails itself of the times and clients are likely to be attracted after the impressive results to be made public in early June Ichirou Hayashi general manager of Nippon Life Insurance Co Ltd's fund management office said The Finance Ministry does not allow disclosure of insurance company figures for the year ended March 31 until early June Nippon Life the largest Japanese insurer had about 50000 investors in variable life by end-March while the three US Firms which offer variable life here have a total of some 7550 investors fund managers said Equitable Life Insurance Co Ltd American Life Insurance Co Ltd and Sony Prudential Life Insurance Co which is a joint venture between Sony Corp and Prudential Life Assurance of the US Are the three US Insurers offering variable life here Although (variable life) appears to be a short-term financial instrument with death benefit its first priority is to raise as much cash value as it can over the long period said Ichiro Kono managing director and chief actuary of Sony Prudential Variable life guarantees a fixed death benefit Variables are also attractive to executives of companies who wish to receive them as retirement funds with options for settlement in annuities Kono said Nippon Life's Hayashi said sales of variable life were shaping up well as interest rate consciousness grows Insurance managers said they expect variables to survive any credit market collapse since the funds should be able to react to interest rate fluctuations more quickly than huge general insurance accounts assuming fund managers grow more sophisticated in global fund and risk management Japanese life insurers have cut dividends paid to holders of regular insurance by as much as 045 of a percentage point since April 1 due to declining domestic interest rates Fund managers said regular insurance funds are invested more conservatively with decisions based on long-term strategies Major life insurers are expected to report huge exchange losses estimated at over 2000 billion yen on foreign investment for 1986/87 they said Asset mix is more of a concept for larger funds not for our variables especially after the huge currency losses made in the last fiscal year Hayashi of Nippon Life said Industry analysts said shifts of funds ahead of tax changes due in October are helping boost the demand for variable life The government is expected to impose a 20 pct withholding tax on interest from certain instruments including single premium endowment insurance much of which is maturing now but variable life will be free of such a tax But Sony Prudential's Kono said A large shift of funds from single premium endowment to variable life is unlikely because investors in the former are more short-term return-minded while the latter doesn't guarantee short-term cash value Sony Prudential and Equitable Life each have three separate variable life accounts Equitable's funds specialise in Japanese stocks US Stocks and money market instruments while Sony's covers bonds stocks and general investment Japanese insurers have only one variable account each The Finance Ministry allowed sales of variable life endowment with terms over 10-years and whole life insurance from October 1 last year but allowed single premiums only on the latter shr 1186 yen vs 1924 Net 3418 billion vs 5944 billion Pretax 7802 billion vs 13052 billion Operating 5158 billion vs 12150 billion Sales 3308 billion vs 3373 billion Deputy President Helmut Schlesinger said the West German central bank had no plan to cut its three pct discount rate Nihon Keizai newspaper reported The financial daily quoted Schlesinger as saying in an interview that the bank would try to maintain current interest rate levels for the time being He also told the newspaper he saw no need for large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market because exchange rates are stable Earlier Schlesinger told a press conference that the Bundesbank would continue its policy of maintaining short-term interest rates at a low level for currency stability He also said he was satisfied with the current dollar/mark exchange rate but added that he was not certain if it was ideal for the West German economy senior Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> executive said he hoped the alleged illegal export of high technology equipment to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba subsidiary would not hurt the parent company's exports to the US Toshiba's 50-pct subsidiary <Toshiba Machine Co Ltd> is a completely independent company with independent management Toshiba Corp senior vice-president Osamu Iemura told a press conference We want to have that fact understood overseas he said Iemura said he had no information to suggest the US Defence Department had broken off talks with Toshiba on the possible procurement of lap top computers because of the illegal exports by Toshiba Machine Kyodo News Agency quoting the weekly magazine US News and World Report said on Saturday the US Air Force had decided to cancel an agreement to buy 100 mln dlrs worth of computers because of Toshiba Machine's illegal exports We have no contract The US Defence Department has been negotiating for procurement with several companies including Toshiba Iemura said Last week police said they had arrested two Toshiba Machine employees on suspicion of illegally exporting high technology equipment to the Soviet Union The Japanese government has already banned further shipments of goods to Communist states by Toshiba Machine for one year and by its export agency C Itoh and Co Ltd <CITTT> for three months Tokyo Commodity Exchange for Industry (TOCOM) said it will allow five more members to become precious metal brokers taking the total to 54 and four more members to broke rubber for a total of 39 An exchange official told the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is expected to approve the the new brokers by mid-June The move has been under study since early May in response to requests by non-broker members of the exchange Corp <TSBAT> expects to report a group net profit of 38 billion yen for the year ending March 31 1988 up 112 pct from a year earlier assuming an exchange rate of 140 yen to the dollar a company official said Osamu Iemura a senior vice president told a news conference sales are forecast at 3500 billion yen up 58 pct The forecasts are based on expectations of improved sales of office automation equipment a recovery in semiconductor market prices and an increase in plant exports Toshiba said earlier that 1986/87 group net profit fell 425 pct from a year earlier to 3418 billion yen the second consecutive year-on-year drop Sales fell 19 pct to 3308 billion yen the first year-on-year sales drop in 21 years Iemura said the results reflected trade friction over semiconductor exports to the US The yen's sharp rise against the dollar and a drop in exports to China The 1986/87 foreign exchange loss totalled 145 billion yen including parent company losses of 120 billion The average value of the yen against the dollar rose to 161 from 221 a year earlier he added Weaker prices for semiconductors and office automation equipment cut total sales 245 billion yen Iemura said Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices accounting for 36 pct of the total rose five pct to 1183 billion yen in 1987/88 from a year earlier helped by good sales of word processors workstations medical equipment point-of-sales systems and exports of personal computers Semiconductor sales rose to 410 billion yen from 360 billion a year earlier but fell short of an expected 430 billion Sales are expected to be 460 billion in 1987/88 Office automation equipment sales rose to 650 billion yen in 1986/87 from 600 billion a year earlier Iemura said Sales in 1987/88 are expected to be 695 billion yen mainly due to good sales of computers in Europe and to expectations the US Will remove its 100 pct import duty on computers Sales of heavy electric goods accounting for 26 pct of sales rose 02 pct from a year earlier to 86814 billion yen Home electronics sales fell 10 pct to 94064 billion yen mainly due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar and a drop in colour television exports to China Iemura said Overall 1986/87 overseas sales totalled 1021 billion yen down three pct from a year earlier Iemura said Overseas sales of telecommunication and electronic devices rose nine pct from a year earlier to 49390 billion yen helped by a 80 pct year-on-year rise in computer and computer-related equipment sales Home appliance sales abroad fell 24 pct to 31210 billion mainly due to the yen's appreciation lower sales to China and increased competition with newly-industrialised countries Toshiba reduced the number of divisions to three from four in reaction to market changes effective April 1 Group sales of telecommunication and electronic devices are estimated at 1520 billion yen in 1987/88 Iemura said Home appliance sales are estimated at 1260 billion yen and heavy electric goods sales at 720 billion Iemura said group exports to China are expected to rise to 90 billion yen in 1987/88 from 30 billion in 1986/87 due to an increase in sales of generators Sales to China were down from 70 billion yen in 1985/86 due to a sharp drop in home appliance exports he said Group capital spending in 1987/88 will fall to 197 billion yen from 21330 billion in 1986/87 Iemura said Of total capital spending investment in semiconductors will fall to 65 billion from 68 billion Research and development spending will rise to 217 billion yen from 20110 billion he said Industrial Bank of Japan <IBJTT> (IBJ) amortized 68 billion yen worth of loans including the write-off of an unspecified amount of loans to the <Japan Line Ltd> group in the year ended March 31 an IBJ spokesman said He declined to comment on a report in the economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun that it had written off loans worth 15 billion yen to Japan Line one of the world's largest tanker operators Japan Line's current liabilities amounted to 6898 billion yen at the end of September In December Japan Line asked its creditor banks to shelve repayment of 124 billion yen of outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries following the yen's steep rise and the world recession in shipping has extended a 24 billion yen loan to Bangladesh Finance Ministry officials said The loan to be disbursed over two years from next July is for chemicals cement steel and machinery imports and for setting up a power plant in eastern Sylhet district they said Terms were not disclosed The credit brings total Japanese loans and grants to Bangladesh to 44125 billion yen since 1972 they said returns by oil refiners and utilities will drag down average current profits of major Japanese firms in the year ending March 31 Wako Research Institute said Current profits will drop an average 135 pct after a 73 pct drop in 1986/87 it said Oil refiners and utilities face a sharp profit fall after two years of high profits due to the yen's strength lower world oil prices and reduced interest rates it said Sales of all firms are expected to rise 23 pct from the previous year when they fell 119 pct from a year earlier The independent institute surveyed 436 firms listed in the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange excluding banks and insurance firms Excluding the oil refiners and utilities Wako forecasts that current profits will rise 37 pct after a 223 pct drop in 1986/87 and a 195 pct drop in 1985/86 Electric power firms and gas companies are likely to see 425 and 316 pct falls in current profits respectively in 1987/88 due to cuts in utility prices to recycle windfall profits made during the yen's rise against the dollar and due to the recent recovery in world oil prices the institute said Current profits of manufacturing industries will rise an average seven pct after a 297 pct drop in 1986/87 and a 250 pct drop in 1985/86 Wako said An increase in overseas production and an expected increase in domestic demand will cause the recovery in manufacturing sector profits it said Co Ltd <SKLKT> said it will issue a 20 billion yen nine-year unsecured convertible bond in the domestic capital market through public placement with Nomura Securities Co Ltd as lead manager Coupon and conversion price for par-priced bond maturing June 28 1996 will be set at its board meeting to be held in mid-June and payment is due on July 1 the company said in a statement Skylark's share price fell 10 yen to 2880 on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today West German car industry celebrated its 100th birthday with a record-breaking 1986 performance at home and is due to turn in another set of solid results in 1987 But share market analysts warn it faces continued problems from the strong German mark and predict increasingly aggressive competition in Europe from the Japanese On the plus side for the industry which is West Germany's biggest foreign exchange earner the analysts are confident the technical superiority and innovative qualities of the luxury producers will help them maintain a strong market profile Most analysts thought Daimler-Benz AG <DAIGF> would do best this year but expected Dr Ing HCF Porsche AG <PSHGF> to continue its slide because of the weak US Dollar They were generally optimistic for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG <BMWGF> (BMW) but some were sceptical it could match record 1986 profits Views were mixed on Volkswagen AG <VOWGF> but some analysts took comfort from the fact that Europe's leading car maker had apparently put a major currency scandal behind it VW could be vulnerable as Japanese exporters suffering from the strength of the yen against the dollar switched their sales offensive from the US To Europe they said Analyst Joseph Rooney with brokers James Capel in London noted the Japanese drive was coming at a time when the whole European market was expected to contract slightly But analysts saw most German manufacturers meeting the challenge even though the Japanese were now starting to focus on the up-market sector BMW's chairman Eberhard von Kuenheim shrugged off the Japanese drive in an interview with Wirtschaftswoche magazineI view the move by the Japanese into the top class with a certain equanimity Not only are we playing on home turf we also have technical superiority he said The car industry benefitted last year from clarification of domestic rules on low-pollution cars which meant orders put off in 1985 were carried out the following year Tax cuts generally boosted domestic demand especially for cars Domestic registrations leapt by nearly 19 pct to a record 28 mln cars The VDA industry association says this might ease to 27 mln in 1987 but predicts another good year Looking to the future Daimler has designated 16 billion marks for car sector spending in the next five years Chairman Werner Breitschwerdt says spending is not aimed at quantity but improving high quality technology and accessories Analyst Stephen Reitman with Phillips and Drew in London said Daimler had the best earnings profile of West German producers with group profits per share rising to 80 marks from 788 in 1986 Analysts were more cautious about VW Reinhard Fischer with Bank in Liechtenstein (BiL) in Frankfurt saw VW's group earnings per share falling to 35 marks in 1987 from 42 in 1986 A recent report from his bank said last year's currency losses were a sign of mismanagement It stressed heavy losses from VW's Brazilian operations and its Spanish unit SEAT VW's first quarter figures also highlighted problems in both the US And Brazil analysts said VW reported flat first quarter earnings except for a 392 pct fall in US Sales and Brazilian sales which dived 465 pct Reitman was more optimistic than BiL about VW's 1987 group earnings and predicting an improvement in both Spain and Brazil he saw an unchanged 42 marks per share  He also said that VW now stood to benefit from not hedging against foreign exchange fluctuations In a May 1 study he wrote: One point in VW's favour is that its extraordinary policy of not hedging forward has meant that it will have less far to go in adjusting to current DM/Dollar rates than the other German manufacturers who were to a lesser or greater extent protected up to 1986 Reitman was also reassured by the apparent end of the currency scandal where allegedly faked forward contracts were not acknowledged by VW's banks VW fixed final losses from the fraud at 473 mln marks for which provisions were made in 1986 VW's new Audi 80 a sporty model which German media reports say was designed to jazz up Audi's staid Grandpa image contributed significantly to VW's first quarter performance The 80 doubled its sales against the year-ago level But the Audi range as a whole has suffered a huge setback in the US Because of an image problem linked to claims of unintentional acceleration Von Kuenheim won't be pinned down on BMW's 1987 profits but at a news conference he emphasised 1986 earnings were a record high Without referring to 1987 he added: If profits are less in one year or the other they will still be good Rooney said group profits per share which BMW does not publish would rise to 625 marks this year Some analysts put the 1986 group profit at 60 marks a figure BMW does not deny But Reitman was more pessimistic predicting 50 marks per share in 1987 and a return to 60 next year He said: BMW will be the story of 1988 when it plans to launch an updated version of its Five series BMW also has a big investment programme under way and Bil's Fischer said depreciations could affect earnings Other analysts pointed to possible hedging problems and Reitman noted a 210 marks to the dollar hedge expired this September Reitman said the outlook for Porsche was bearish for the year to end-July 1987 Porsche's 1985/86 group profits at 84 marks per share fell 30 pct from the record 120 marks in 1984/85 and Reitman saw 60 marks in 1986/87 With the US Currently accounting for 63 pct of unit sales (this is expected to fall to 60 pct in the full year 1986/87) Porsche's earnings remain uncomfortably exposed to the DM/dollar relationship he said Airport Services Ltd> (BAS) has concluded an 18 mln yen contract with the <Kansai International Airport Co Ltd> for consulting work on the terminal at a new airport to be built in western Japan the airport company said in a statement The contract is the first to be awarded to a British company and follows the award of a 200000 dlr consultancy contract to a division of the US-based <Bechtel International Corp> in consortium with six Japanese companies a company spokesman told BAS is a subsidiary of <BAA Plc> the former British Airports Authority The six-billion dlr project to build the airport has been a major source of friction with the US And the European Community who have put pressure on Japan to allow foreign companies to compete with domestic firms in building it oil prices could remain around 18 dlrs a barrel until the end of the year but OPEC's decision on output at its next meeting would be the critical factor an official of Mexico's state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) told a group of Japanese businessmen Adrian Lajous Pemex' executive vice president of international trade said current OPEC output already appeared to be very near the 166 mln barrel per day level it set itself for the third quarter Production is surging ahead of what was originally planned while demand is growing more slowly than envisaged a few months ago he said He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the 18 dlrs price and that an increase to what had originally been envisaged might soften price levels The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in terms of volume decisions Lajous said A repetition of what happened last year when OPEC boosted output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs is always there as a possibility he said I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986 I expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and discipline will be maintained he said Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil markets but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during 1987 if output remains under control He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month that increased production was not so important as long as incomes would not be affected by the output were very relevant and welcome from such a powerful producer Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) has asked federal regulators for authority to trade a futures contract in long-term Japanese government bonds The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said it has received an application from CBT for a contract comprised of yen bonds with a face value at maturity of 100 mln yen The price of the proposed contract would be quoted in points per 100 yen par value with one point equal to one mln yen The minimum price fluctuation would be 10000 yen per contract and the contract would have no daily price limits CFTC has requested public comment on the proposal International Inc said it has completed previously-announced transactions involving its grocery products businesses in four Asian countries with Ajinomoto Co Inc <AJINT> raising about 300 mln dlrs It said it will receive about 40 mln dlrs more later mostly this month when closings are expected in three more countries Proceeds will be used mostly for debt reduction CPC said Ajinomoto has purchased its equity in Knorr Foods Co Ltd a joint venture in Japan between the two companies with CPC to get fees for trademark and technology use CPC said Ajinomoto is also purchasing 50 pct interests in CPC's wholly-owned subsidiaries in Hong Kong Malaysia the Philippines Singapore Taiwan and Thailand Chicago Board of Trade CBT has asked federal regulators for authority to trade a futures contract in long-term Japanese government bonds The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC said it has received an application from CBT for a contract comprised of yen bonds with a face value at maturity of 100 mln yen The price of the proposed contract would be quoted in points per 100 yen par value with one point equal to one mln yen The minimum price fluctuation would be 10000 yen per contract and the contract would have no daily price limits CFTC has requested public comment on the proposal Community diplomats said the question of whether Eurobonds will fall under proposed EC rules requiring new securities issues in Community countries to be preceded by a prospectus has yet to be resolved The UK Securities industry has been lobbying hard against an EC Commission proposal aimed at protecting investors that would require publication and approval of a prospectus before all public offers of securities The proposed directive currently includes Eurobonds although it makes an exception to the prospectus rules for issues directed exclusively at professional investors Diplomats said that with Britain tending towards backing West Germany and Luxembourg in their opposition to the inclusion of Eurobonds the question of whether they would remain within the scope of the directive or not was wide open Everything is in the melting pot said one diplomat who declined to be named The diplomats said Belgium has now given up attempts to have the directive adopted by EC ministers before it hands over the presidency of the 12-nation Community to Denmark on July 1 It was not immediately clear what priority the Danes would attach to getting the proposals through during their six month tenure Meanwhile discussions on the directive at working group level have halted diplomats said Officials of the EC Commission said it recognised that its proposals created a conflict between the need for greater protection of investors on the one hand and for banks and other institutions to place Eurobonds quickly on the other It's a problem and we are still in the grips of internal debate as to the right line to take said one Commission official Eurobonds were not included in the original draft directive first put forward in 1981 but were brought into its scope later at the request of a number of EC member states Diplomats said countries that oppose the inclusion of Eurobonds in the proposals are worried that the prospectus requirements would prevent the thriving Eurobond market from functioning as well as it does now With timing so essential to the market for placing and distribution there's just not time to deal with these bureaucratic hurdles said one He and others said the overriding concern was that the requirements could drive the Eurobond market out of traditional EC centres like London and Luxembourg to Switzerland the US Or Japan Diplomats said the Eurobond question is not the only issue that needs to be resolved before the directive can be passed They said West Germany's main objection to the directive in its present form is that it considers as too stringent proposed rules laying down how much information companies issuing non-listed securities should disclose in their prospectuses The proposed rules create problems for West Germany because its new second tier securities market has less demanding requirements that would have to be tightened Germany will stand firm at next week's economic summit in Venice against foreign pressure to follow Japan's example of a multi-billion dlr package to stimulate the economy West German officials said They conceded Japan's announcement last week of a 6000 billion yen plan to bolster its economy would throw the spotlight back on West Germany which would face redoubled calls from its partners to stimulate sluggish growth (See ECRA page for latest Economic Spotlights) This view has already been voiced in Washington where officials spoke at the weekend of behind-the-scenes consultations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl with the aim of securing a quick pledge to take action on the economy Italy's central bank governor Carlo Ciampi has also criticized West Germany's reluctance to utilize its economic potential for expansionary policies But West German officials said it was virtually inconceivable that Kohl would make any concessions in Venice despite a sharp economic downswing at the start of this year There is just no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves said one official echoing statements by both Kohl and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg Stoltenberg already has problems finding the cash to finance a series of tax cuts promised for 1990 and has said his budget is now stretched to the limit He is reluctantly letting government borrowing rise while federal income falls as a result of the tax cuts which he hopes will stimulate growth and satisfy foreign critics West Germany is exhausting to the furthest possible limit its fiscal scope as far as growth and employment is concerned Stoltenberg said last month But US Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said Europeans and the US Were worried by flagging German growth We and others are concerned about the continued signs of weakness in the German economy he said Other US Officials said France shared these worries Kohl will go to Venice only days after the publication of figures expected to show that the West German economy actually contracted in the first three months of 1987 West Germany has pledged to review possible measures should further growth be endangered but officials say they do not expect such a review to be necessary Bonn says the economy rebounded in the second quarter and it predicts growth of just under two pct for the year West Germany's trading partners are also likely to wait in in vain for any further pump-priming from the Bundesbank Bundesbank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger made clear today the bank would keep interest rates down but said there were no plans for a cut in the Bundesbank's key discount rate which at three pct is near historical lows Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also spoke over the weekend of the need for all countries to play a role on the international economic scene We have to recognise that there are also limits to economic growth in a country like Germany he said This stance was taken by Kohl when he outlined expectations for the Venice summit in an interview last week Referring to West Germany's program of tax cuts and its low interest rates he said With these policies we have made a significant contribution to growth and to a balanced development of the world economy Kohl expected no new initiatives from Venice though he reckoned on confirmation of agreed policies such as a pact made in Paris in February which sought to stabilize the dollar That pact involved a pledge from the United States and Japan respectively to cut the massive American budget deficit and to stimulate Japanese demand Kohl said he would remind both Washington and Tokyo of those promises law enforcement authorities said they began a criminal investigation of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co after the company imported herbicide-tainted tobacco and then exported tainted cigarettes to Japan We can confirm that the US Customs Service has launched a criminal investigation of Reynolds a Customs spokesman told There is an investigation under way said Bob Edmunds the US attorney in Greensboro NC Reynolds is a subsidiary of RJR Nabisco Inc of Winston-Salem NC The investigation is particularly embarrassing--for Tokyo and Washington as well as the company--because the Japanese government under pressure from the United States agreed only last year to open its markets to US-made tobacco products RJ Reynolds spokesman David Fishel said in a telephone interview that his company acknowledged importing into the United States large amounts of tobacco treated with a weedkiller called Dicamba and then exporting cigarettes made with the tobacco to Japan He acknowledged the weed killer was present in the tobacco at levels exceeding US standards but said use of the tobacco did not pose a threat to human health Dicamba is approved by the government for use on a variety of crops including food crops and is widely used as a ripening agent on tobacco Fishel said Earlier today Japanese Finance Ministry official Etsuzo Kawade said in Tokyo that government authorities were holding a large shipment of Winston Lights manufactured by RJ Reynolds after tests showed some of them contained unacceptable amounts of the weedkiller We do not believe the herbicide posed a serious threat to people's health but the levels were unacceptable by law Kawade said free market tin traders made a somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October Traders said the new market would probably be a useful trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin interests although European traders generally appear to be reasonably satisfied with the current free market system which has been operating since London Metal Exchange LME tin trading ceased in October 1985 Dealers here will also want to see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries There is also a view among European traders that while the proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another useful reference point a market inaugurated by the Malaysian government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of trading on the London Metal Exchange but they added that while there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court litigation actions have been resolved Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently around 4200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse Rotterdam Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten year low of 3400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as 4680 stg in December 1986 This compares with 8140 stg last paid when LME trading ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10350 stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28065 tonnes having fallen steadily from a record high of 72485 tonnes reached in February 1986 Traders said the free market turned bullish during late last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand deficit of some 28000/29000 tonnes Analysts were predicting prices of up to 5000 stg per tonne during 1987 However the trend was reversed following a strong upswing in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to 4100 stg last month after approaching 4700 stg in December The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers There was also a lack of significant demand from major steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin holdings of nearly 45000 tonnes have now been almost halved and the bulk of material still available is being held by Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the market with unwanted metal Some 80000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the International Tin Council's ITC buffer stock manager halted support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members nations of the International Tin Agreement The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker Shearson Lehman Brothers which earlier this year reported having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin position Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin prices and movements are still expected to be largely related to currency fluctuations unless significant consumer demand emerges for the third quarter The Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC has made efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an export control umbrella but to date Brazil and China two major producers remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to consumers in main European trading centres dealers said Reagan said he will use the annual economic summit of major industrialized countries to press for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan In a pre-summit speech at the White House Reagan said that preserving a growing world economy was the business of every member of the world trading community It will be made clear especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bloster the world trading system on which they depend he said Reagan said he would discuss the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in preserving free navigation In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack Reagan said the American people were aware that it is not our interests alone that are being protected Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret Reagan declared During the upcoming summit in Venice we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf The future belongs to the brave Free men should not cower before such challenges and they should not expect to stand alone Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain France West Germany Italy Canada and Japan at the economic summit which will take place in Venice June 8-10 The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the US frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests Reagan said In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan Reagan who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system While the vibrancy of the US economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community he said It will be made clear especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten he said The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action Associates Inc said it established a new business unit to establish its presence in Australia New Zealand Spain South and Central AMerica Africa Middle East and the Far East The new unit will explore opportunities for the establishment of marketing agreements that address secondary markets for the company's technology and will evaluate opportunities in Japan it said vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark Schlesinger told that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed The economy is picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth he added We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter he said in an interview Concerned by the first quarter downturn the US Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports either through fiscal or monetary policy Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions just as occured in 1986 Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly he said noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct well above the Bundesbank's three to six pct target He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows Heavy inflows particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation boosted domestic money supply There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed Schlesinger said A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction that the mark was headed higher As we can see from the market expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished Schlesinger said The recent widening of interest rate differentials the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar he said Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise as the US Did in March when the dollar rose above 187 marks he said this would depend on the circumstances At midday here the dollar stood at 18340/45 marks Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react Schelsinger said One has to look at how it (the market) is moving he said adding It is not only our own case it is also the American case He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now But it wouldn't be good to have short-term fluctuations he said Let us wait and see It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock than the level (of rates) as such Schlesinger said The sharp rise of the mark coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged at about one to 1-1/2 pct he said Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council Schlesigner said But he added: I don't see any great pressure to go away from it of Japan's oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups industry sources said They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) A spokesman for a major firm said Deregulation would bring about a reorganization If it's a by-product of freer competition we have no choice but to accept it The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12 The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry It should cut capacity to 38 mln barrels per day about 75 pct of current capacity Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output and oil tariffs should be abolished They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency and most saw it as inevitable Deregulation is taking place everywhere Now it's our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition said a source at one major Japanese oil company A spokesman for a smaller refiner said We'll have a hard time surviving but that's something we must go through In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies he said Larger companies are also streamlining Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985 cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986 Cosmo Oil Co Ltd the third largest seller of oil products in 1985 cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year a spokesman for the company said Between 1984 and 1986 on the recommendation of the Council 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups MITI means business It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles a source said A MITI official told he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls He declined to officially confirm or deny that the Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards deregulation shr - 1356 yen vs 2706 Net - 2161 billion vs 3893 billion Current - 3766 billion vs 4670 billion Operating - 5737 billion vs 7991 billion Sales - 1789 billion vs 1692 billion was ready to use diplomacy to help maintain the security of the Gulf Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take a broad political stance Officials of the foreign ministry said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and Iraq which have been at war since September 1980 Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial help to patrol the waters of the Gulf About 60 pct of Japan's crude oil passes through the waterway President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda for next week's G-7 summit in Venice Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional expressions of concern and he has called on US Allies to help maintain freedom of navigation Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being deployed overseas Nakasone has said that Washington understands this problem Ltd <ITSUT> has forecast that group net profits will rise 759 pct in the current year to 38 billion yen and current profits will rise 726 pct to 65 billion the company said in its earnings statement Sales are expected to rise 14 pct to 2040 billion yen in the same period it said tax revenues for the 1986/87 year ended March 31 were more than 600 billion yen higher than forecast and could be used to help fund the economic package announced last week Finance Ministry sources said The final figure for 1986/87 will not be available until next month but some local newspapers speculated that the carryover could be as much as 1000 billion yen The government is due to introduce a supplementary budget during an extarordinary parliamentary session expected to start in July The budget will be used to finance the central government share of last Friday's emergency economic package That package totalled more than 6000 billion yen including more than 1000 billion in tax cuts Government officials including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa have previously said possible revenue sources for tax cuts include the tax revenue carryover from 1986/87 and proceeds from the sale of shares in the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp The sale of 195 mln NTT shares in 1986/87 left about 450 billion yen available for use as a revenue source for tax cuts the sources said Another 195 mln are expected to be sold in the current fiscal year Ltd <ITSUT> and International Business Machines Corp <IBMN> (IBM) had resolved some issues in a longstanding dispute over software copyright protection Fujitsu said in a prospectus for a warrant bond recently issued in London The dispute involved questions of contractual interpretation arising from a 1983 agreement between the companies the prospectus said Under question was how much software information the firms were obliged to disclose to each other The case had been before the American Arbitration Association (AAA) since 1985 By subsequent agreements the parties have resolved some of the issues and have established procedures to resolve presently outstanding disputes with the involvement of the members of the panel of arbitrators the prospectus said The Company is not in a position to predict with certainty the outcome of this process and its effect on the future results or operations financial or otherwise of the Group it said A Fujitsu spokeswoman declined to comment on the prospectus noting the dispute remained under arbitration by the AAA An IBM spokesman here also declined comment Last November the AAA ordered both companies to maintain the confidentiality of the arbitration proceedings and said that both Fujitsu and IBM had agreed that no additional comment on the subject be made Late last year IBM and Hitachi Ltd <HITT> said they had agreed to revise a separate 1983 agreement which arose out of software disputes similar to those between Fujitsu and IBM Finance Ministry would raise lending limits on local non-life insurance firms to meet the increasing need for efficient fund management a ministry spokesman said He said the allowable non-collateral lending limits would be increased to 30 pct of each insurer's total assets from 25 pct and that overseas subsidiaries will be made eligible as borrowers The lending limit for non-life insurers which do not satisfy criteria for making non-collateral loans would be expanded to three pct of total assets from one pct The upper limit of lending of securities by non-life insurance companies now set at five pct of each insurer's total assets would be abolished the official said This will enable such lending by non-life insurers to be included in the separate category of money lending which is limited to 55 pct of the total assets of each insurer Approvals for the changes which must be given to each insurer on application were expected to begin soon possibly as early as next week Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said it would issue guidelines later this month for microchip production during the third quarter A MITI official said it was too early to say if the guidelines would call for reductions following similar government requests in the first two quarters of 1987 This is not a matter which should be decided on a political basis alone the official told MITI asked that production of 256 kilobit dynamic random access memory chips and erasable programmable read only memory chips be cut by 11 pct during the April/June quarter Production was cut back 10 pct in the first quarter and industry analysts said the reductions have boosted prices US And Japanese officials met in Washington last week to discuss the removal of US Sanctions against some Japanese exports but both sides agreed not to reveal the outcome of the talks the MITI official added Washington imposed the sanctions in April saying Tokyo had failed to abide by a 1986 pact on microchip trade Highway Public Corp planned to issue a seven-year government-guaranteed 120 mln European currency unit (ecu) bond with coupon at 7375 pct late this month a corporation spokeman told Issue price would be 101125 pct to yield 7165 pct Lead manager was Bank of Tokyo Capital Market Ltd a subsidiary of the Bank of Tokyo in Britain and co-lead manager Credit Commercial de France he added He declined to give other details planned to buy a three billion yen supercomputer as part of a policy of importing more US Goods a spokesman for the private business group Kansai Economic Federation told by telephone from Osaka The supercomputer would be bought from Cray Research Inc <CYRN> of the US The spokesman said He said the supercomputer would not necessarily be bought this year but eventually it would be installed at the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International The Institute conducts telecommunications research and was formed in 1986 with government and private funds The United States has been pressing Japan to open its public sector market to sales of US Supercomputers Ministry of International Trade and Industry officials concerned with the supercomputer issue were unavailable for comment Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone today agreed with Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita that a further cut in the discount rate was not appropriate at present central bank sources said They told the two discussed the subject at a routine meeting Sumita told Nakasone he did not feel a rate cut was appropriate and Nakasone expressed his understanding the sources said Currency dealers have speculated that Japan and West Germany might come under pressure at next week's Venice summit to cut interest rates to boost their economies Nakasone but not Sumita is due to attend the summit Finance Ministry would raise lending limits on local non-life insurance firms to meet the increasing need for efficient fund management a ministry spokesman said He said the allowable non-collateral lending limits would be increased to 30 pct of each insurer's total assets from 25 pct and that overseas subsidiaries will be made eligible as borrowers The lending limit for non-life insurers which do not satisfy criteria for making non-collateral loans would be expanded to three pct of total assets from one pct The upper limit of lending of securities by non-life insurance companies now set at five pct of each insurer's total assets would be abolished the official said This will enable such lending by non-life insurers to be included in the separate category of money lending which is limited to 55 pct of the total assets of each insurer Approvals for the changes which must be given to each insurer on application were expected to begin soon possibly as early as next week tax revenues for the 1986/87 year ended March 31 were more than 600 billion yen higher than forecast and could be used to help fund the economic package announced last week Finance Ministry sources said The final figure for 1986/87 will not be available until next month but some local newspapers speculated that the carryover could be as much as 1000 billion yen The government is due to introduce a supplementary budget during an extarordinary parliamentary session expected to start in July The budget will be used to finance the central government share of last Friday's emergency economic package That package totalled more than 6000 billion yen including more than 1000 billion in tax cuts Government officials including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa have previously said possible revenue sources for tax cuts include the tax revenue carryover from 1986/87 and proceeds from the sale of shares in the privatized Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp The sale of 195 mln NTT shares in 1986/87 left about 450 billion yen available for use as a revenue source for tax cuts the sources said Another 195 mln are expected to be sold in the current fiscal year is disappointed at the recent threats of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as the trade situation between the two is improving Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement he said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides Last week foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC manufactured goods in the year ended March 31 I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through expansion While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit between Japan and the EC I believe it should be rectified not by reducing trade through import restrictions or export restraints but by expanding the (overall) trade Tamura said Venice summit on June 8-10 is likely to disappoint those hoping for new policies to whip up flagging world growth according to officials from summit countries Worries over protectionist threats and the Third World debt crisis are also unlikely to be assuaged they added The talks may yield agreed statements on the military situation in the Gulf co-operation in the fight against the killer disease AIDS or on East-West relations they said But most summit participants have made it clear that major new initiatives on economic issues must not be expected West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in a recent interview that the translation of previous announcements into policy is more important than new declarations and commitments The main goal at the summit would be to strengthen existing agreements to secure steady medium term growth and avoid the danger of a further devaluation of the dollar via close co-operation on economic and financial policies Kohl added Critics challenged this view They pointed to the worrying background of slower growth especially in Japan and Germany amid fears about a pickup in inflation in the US Which could lead to higher interest rates and exacerbate the debt crisis The marginal impact that the major shifts in dollar yen and mark exchange rates have had on the Japanese and German trade surpluses and US Trade and fiscal deficits since the September 1985 Plaza agreement was also a cause for concern Economists said the recent rise in the dollar was likely to be quickly reversed in the absence of new commitments in Venice But government officials do not expect summit delegations - from the US Japan Germany Britain France Italy Canada and the European Community - to go much beyond restating policy goals enshrined in the February Louvre agreement of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers Under the agreement aimed at halting the dollar's 20-month decline and at fostering balanced growth Japan and West Germany would work to eliminate their trade and payments surpluses in return for a US Pledge to reduce fiscal deficits A 6000 billion yen package announced by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week went some way towards that goal and appeared to have saved Japan from a widely anticipated summit attack on its economic policies officials said The package featuring government spending and tax cuts to stimulate demand drew a cautious welcome in European capitals but its reception in the US Was much more enthusiastic Treasury Secretary James Baker commented Of course implementation is the key but this is clearly forward movement toward fulfillment by Japan of its commitments With Japan signalling its willingness to boost domestic demand rather than rely on exports for growth the US And other summit countries were now set to shift their attention to West Germany and press Kohl for similar action officials said US Assistant treasury secretary David Mulford said there was worldwide concern that German economic growth has flagged and the US Would demand that Kohl confirm a commitment that policies would be reviewed if growth continued sluggish But West German officials said Kohl would fiercely resist any such pressure One senior Bonn official said There is just no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has problems finding cash to finance tax cuts promised for 1990 and is reluctantly letting government borrowing rise Bonn officials said Citing fierce opposition by West Germany and Britain European officials also ruled out progress on US Plans for a more formal strategy for coordinating economic policies based on a series of economic indicators The US Wants other Group of Seven countries to agree to high level consultations when the indicators including trade growth interest and exchange rates inflation and fiscal deficits show members are not living up to economic commitments But Germany and Britain fear the plan would undermine economic sovereignty and Britain also feels the proposals are too complicated and too rigid officials said Recent developments on Third World debt including moves by two of the largest US Banks to set aside billions of dollars to cover bad loans will feature prominently in the talks US And Japanese officials said they would seek to reactivate the Baker initiative at the summit and renew a call to commercial banks to come up with a menu of alternatives to restore some new bank lending to debtor countries Officials said there was also scope for agreement on a Franco-British plan aimed at alleviating the burden for the world's poorest debtor countries through concessional rescheduling of their sovereign debt at the Paris Club The talks would also include plans to dismantle runaway farm subsidies all summit nations pay to guarantee the income of their farmers and secure a share of world markets they said The 24 members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) last month supported a gradual decoupling of farm production subsidies from income support for farmers The US Canada and Britain in particular are keen to move quickly after the OECD breakthrough officials said What we want is not for treasuries to compete as they do now We want to see to it that our farmers will be able to compete in international markets Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said The US Intends to table specific proposals on the issue at GATT the world trade body immediately after the summit to signal that it wants negotiations on farm trade to take precedence over the other trade issues included in the new GATT round of talks launched last year in Punta del Este Uruguay We won't have much tolerance for delay US Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said But European officials said they would resist such moves making an agreement at the summit unlikely France and other EC countries insist that farm trade disputes be resolved as part of a wider trade settlement within GATT they said Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the economic summit in Venice on June 8-10 UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said Previewing the summit which he expected would not produce any major new economic initiatives Lawson told reporters work remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting world economic growth side measures to boost growth he said I think it is possible that there may be scope for a further reduction in interest rates in Germany he added but stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was likely He made no mention of Japanese interest rates Lawson said the US Should embark on a gradual reduction of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced satisfactory exchange rate stability in part thanks to heavy coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks and he was content with sterling's exchange rate Pointing to the record 48 billion stg rise in UK May currency reserves announced today he said we have been playing a very full part ourselves  We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we had done hitherto Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic commitments underlying the accord Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their commitments in Paris  In this respect He said the US Budget deficit was very important Noting the 6000 billion yen economic package announced by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson said what is really needed in Japan is an increase in merchandise imports Supply side measures are critical There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is wholly unjustified he said Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in Japan bashing at the summit especially after the economic stimulation package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase Japanese development aid over the next three years Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange membership would also help deflect criticism he said He said he thought West Germany would instead come under pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to jack up faltering economic growth In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts scheduled for 1990 He also called on Bonn to push ahead with the privatisation of German national industries On debt Lawson said he expected a three point British plan to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to make progress in Venice The plan involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign debt in the Paris Club was first proposed at the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year Lawson said he would seek to consolidate political backing for the plan at the Venice summit and hoped the programme would be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt provisions First it is a blow for realism Second because the market response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this sort of move than they felt before Citicorp he said UK Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions They have done it to some extent they need to do it more Lawson said adding it was up to the banks themselves to determine the appropriate size of provisions He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be discussed at the summit There is a consensus which we have to push further of farmers gathered in central Tokyo to urge the government to stand firm against foreign pressure for further opening up of Japan's markets to foreign agricultural products union officials said Officials of the Central Union of Agricultural Cooperatives said about 5000 representatives from 4200 farming groups joined the demonstration The organisers said the farmers demanded that the government should avoid easy compromises on liberalising agricultural imports at next week's economic summit in Venice The United States and the European Community want Japan to remove tariffs and quotas to help cut their trade deficits with Japan Under a banner reading The government and parliament must not sacrifice farmers the demonstrators adopted a declaration saying they would fight any unreasonable moves to open Japanese markets to foreign agricultural products An agriculture ministry official said Japan and the United States were expected to hold talks on Japanese import ceilings for US Beef and citrus fruit in September White House has completed a new review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last April should be lifted US officials said They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at Japan's adherence to the 1986 US-Japanese semiconductor pact yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly But there was no hint what the announcement might be Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact But they also noted that the White House has said it was unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10 The officials added that while the curbs complicated US-Japanese economic cooperation they did serve to blunt Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not taking tough actions to reduce he US trade deficit Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to US goods The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television sets personal computers and hand-held power tools Reagan in imposing the curbs said they would be lifted as soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering to the pact of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said satisfactory progress has been made in talks with Japan that would lead to membership of the Tokyo Stock Exchange for three British merchant banks next year Following weekend talks here between Japanese and British officials Lawson told reporters we have achieved our objective The three applicants <Baring Brothers and Co Ltd> <JHenry Wagg and Co Ltd> and Kleinwort Benson Lonsdale Plc <KSLLL> would join when the Stock Exchange has been extended he said The TSE has said this will be completed in May 1988 It has repeatedly said it cannot accommodate any new members until then because of limited space on its trading floor During a visit to Tokyo in April UK Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard presented Japanese officials with what he called a non-negotiable timetable for granting the three British securities companies TSE membership Howard said Britain expected a favourable response at last weekend's meeting and wanted the firms to be made members before next May If Tokyo failed to act Britain was ready to retaliate against Japanese financial groups in London he added Last month the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced plans to set up a special committee to study the membership question The committee is due to produce a report by the autumn This would allow the TSE to announce formally by the end of the year who will be granted membership although the companies chosen would not be able to start trading until May Secretary of State George Shultz said the 6000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last week went further than the US Had expected But he said the US Would not lift the selective economic sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips Speaking in a televised news conference linking several European capitals Shultz said it was heartening that the Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and global demand There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was originally thought said Shultz speaking from Washington It is a lot more than nothing It is more than was talked about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the economy he added But asked by Japanese reporters also linked into the news conference whether the positive reaction meant the US Might decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on some Japanese electronic goods Shultz replied: These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an agreement that had been reached between the United States and Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip market They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the agreement that it made become evident He said US Officials had only been able to monitor the situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a trend on only one month's data The US Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal computers colour televisions and power tools alleging that Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by selling computer chips at below fair market value Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand Asked whether the US Could reasonably ask its allies to take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget deficit Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the problem He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against last year and that the budget being worked on this year would contain a major reduction US meat industry has launched an aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer awareness of US beef and persuade the Japanese government to relax current beef import quotas US beef sales to Japan currently around 480 mln dlrs annually could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the attributes of US beef officials of the US Meat Export Federation said at a press conference today Partially funded with a 65 mln dlr award made through the Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) program a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was launched by the US Meat Export Federation in April The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the bright spots for US agricultural exports said Philip Seng Asian Director for the Federation We supply and they (Japan) buy a very high quality of beef They like our beef and want to buy more he said Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system which limits total Japanese beef imports to 177000 tonnes per year and US imports to 58400 tonnes as the major constraint in expanding US beef shipments to Japan The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy Japanese foreign beef imports The current quota agreement expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get underway this fall The Reagan administration has called for an end to the quotas by April 1988 but Japanese officials have said they would not liberalize imports regardless of the US pressure Officials from the Meat Export Federation told that they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota but that they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market has also kept beef consumption at modest levels meat industry officials said Japanese shoppers pay an average of 2714 dlrs for a US tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 4742 dlrs for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak the meat association said At the retail level US striploin sells for 977 dlrs per pound while Japanese beef sells for 2851 dlrs per lb Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef per year compared to 78 lbs for the average American officials said Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700000 to 800000 tonnes per year but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a decrease in beef prices consumption could increase to 32 mln tonnes Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MCT> Mazda Motor Corp <MAZTT> and Ford Motor Co <F> have signed an agreement to set up a joint venture to make car air conditioners in Japan Matsushita said in a statement The new venture <Japan Climate Systems Corp> will be capitalised at 15 billion yen and the three partners will hold equal shares The partners will invest 36 billion yen in constructing a plant in Hiroshima due for completion in late 1988 The plant will initially make 100000 air conditioners a year for Mazda it said Matsushita Electric Co Ltd <MCT> joint venture will make VHS-format video tape recorders (vtrs) in Brazil for the domestic market in the face of government quotas on vtr imports a Matsushita spokesman told <Springer National de Amazonia SA> will start output in early 1988 at a rate of 20000 vtrs the first year he said Springer National located in Manaus and capitalised at 8993 mln cruzeiros is owned 51 pct by <Springer SA> of Brazil and 49 pct by Matsushita unit <National do Brasil Ltd> It was formed in July 1981 to make colour televisions audio equipment and microwave ovens Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said the dollar's sharp fall against the yen overnight was only temporary The dollar dropped sharply in New York after news that Paul Volcker would step down as chairman of the US Federal Reserve Nakasone told reporters he did not expect US Policy to change after Volcker steps down crushers have bought 3000 to 5000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed trade sources said Delivery dates and price details were not available dollar should worth more than 170 yen based on purchasing power parity the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on international trade Using 1973 as a base year the ministry said inflation differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth quarter 1986 The dollar opened here today at 14490 yen MITI also said the so-called J-curve and the drop in oil prices together accounted for 332 billion dlrs of the 366 billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year On a customs cleared basis the Japanese trade surplus rose to a record 8266 billion dlrs last year The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 165 billion dlrs and the J-curve 172 billion dlrs of the rise in the 1986 surplus Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in recent years MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be accounted for by exchange rates 24 pct by differences in economic growth rates between Japan and other countries and 36 pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports Analyzing the expansion in the US Trade deficit from 1982 to 1985 the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange rates 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic growth rates The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other minor factors have been left out One index of trade structure the income elasticity of exports and imports shows that the US Is more likely to experience increases in imports while Japan is structurally predisposed to growth in exports MITI said Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan under the impact of the strong yen MITI said Japanese companies are stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing The ministry cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor in the purchase of imports from the US And Western Europe replacing design and brand reputations The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for measures to address the needs of affected firms it said Whole industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to suffer Sustained economic growth led by domestic demand will also be an essential condition the ministry said It said four structural factors have contributed to the growth of the US Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline in US Industrial competitiveness insufficient productive capacity an increase in foreign procurement by US Companies and short-sighted US Management attitudes While (US) exports have picked up somewhat with the dollar's fall in value no marked improvements have appeared in the import picture MITI said Japanese economy has bottomed out after an extended period of stagnation Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a press conference But he said he was not too optimistic about the state of the economy as the employment situation was still shaky in certain regions of the country Yesterday the Finance Ministry said its quarterly corporate survey showed that the economy was showing increasing signs of recovery crushers have so far bought 50000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment in late July/August and total purchases for the period are likely to be around 130000 tonnes trade sources said Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June and July to 111000 from 120000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenance work at oil mills But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightly above monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for a while due to a better crushing margin compared with that of soybeans they said gross national product (gnp) rose a real 12 pct in the January/March quarter after a downwardly revised 07 pct increase in the previous three months the Economic Planning Agency said The October/December rise was originally put at 08 pct For the fiscal year ended last March 31 gnp rose 26 pct after a 43 pct increase in 1985/86 Last year's performance was the worst since 1974/75 when gnp contracted by 04 pct and was below the government's revised three pct forecast Economists said the strong yen was largely to blame for the slowdown in economic growth in 1986/87 Domestic demand increased 07 pct in the January/March quarter and 43 pct in the fiscal year compared with growth of 06 pct in October/December and 37 pct in 1985/86 The annualized growth rate in the January/March quarter accelerated to 49 pct from 29 pct in October/December In nominal terms gnp rose 07 pct in January/March after a 05 pct October/December rise reflecting lower prices Domestic demand contributed 07 percentage point to real gnp growth in January/March while foreign trade added 05 point In October/December domestic demand contributed 06 point while foreign trade added 02 point Of the 05 point contribution of foreign trade to gnp last quarter rising exports accounted for 03 point and falling imports contributed 02 Total export volume rose 20 pct quarter-on-quarter in January/March while imports fell 12 pct Of the 07 point contribution of domestic demand to January/March gnp growth the private sector accounted for 11 point while the public sector knocked off 04 The private sector contribution included 04 point for corporate capital outlays and 10 for consumer spending while destocking subtracted 03 point In 1986/87 domestic demand contributed 41 percentage points to growth while foreign trade knocked off 15 points In 1985/86 the domestic demand contribution was 36 points and foreign trade 07 point broadly defined money supply average of M-2 plus certificates of deposit (CD) jumped a preliminary 102 pct in May from a year earlier the Bank of Japan said The increase is the largest year-on-year rise since March 1982 when the money supply gained 105 pct The money supply had increased 98 pct in April The seasonally adjusted average in May rose 10 pct from the previous month Unadjusted M-2 plus CDs were an average 347200 billion yen in May against 345500 billion in April four Japanese makers of large trucks will stop exports to North Korea following the issue of Japanese government guidance company spokesmen told The move responds to the US Government's expression of concern that North Korea was using Japanese-made trucks as missile launching pads they said <Nissan Diesel Motor Co Ltd> shipped 156 vehicles including large and mid-sized trucks and buses to North Korea in 1986 while Isuzu Motors Ltd <ISUMT> exported more than 100 six to eight-tonne trucks in 1986 company spokesmen said A spokesman for Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMTT> said it had almost no trade with North Korea last year <Hino Motors Ltd> shipped 28 five-tonne trucks in 1986 a company spokesman said Ministers of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (ASEAN) said they expect closer economic ties with Japan A communique issued at the end of a two-day ministerial meeting said Asean hoped for greater Japanese investment in the region better access for Asean products in the Japanese market and larger numbers of visiting Japanese tourists The ministers are due to start four days of talks tomorrow with officials of the US Japan the European Community New Zealand Australia and Canada including Secretary of State George Shultz and Japan's Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari The Asean communique noted Japan's large trade surplus which it said would enable Tokyo to play a greater role in the economic development of ASEAN and in facilitating closer ASEAN economic cooperation Japan could also help to facilitate the flow of Japanese investments to ASEAN through the provision of attractive financial assistance and incentives for its private sector it said The communique also welcomed President Reagan's firm action in vetoing trade protectionist measures in the Congress The communique said the ASEAN ministers were concerned over the proliferation of protectionist policies pressures and measures in developed countries the continued depressed level of commodity prices the instability of exchange rates and the lack of a comprehensive solution to the world debt situation Heavy Industries Ltd <MITHT> said it began building the world's most advanced energy-saving tanker which consumes only 48 tonnes of fuel oil a day Construction of the 258000 dwt VLCC (very large crude carrier) Nisseki Maru for <Tokyo Tanker Co Ltd> a shipping arm of Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOLT> is expected to be completed in April 1988 It would run on the Japan/Gulf route a company statement said The statement gave no other details Mitsubishi Heavy last year finished building a vlcc of similar size but which consumed 57 tonnes of fuel a day Bank of Japan is considering expanding the 60 billion yen daily limit on each securities firm's outstanding transactions in the yen call market at the request of the securities industry Bank of Japan sources said But before doing this the Bank is waiting to see the effect on brokers' fund raising of the change effective in August to a shorter settlement period for cash bond transactions the sources said Motor Corp <TOYOT> is likely to raise 800 mln dlrs through a Eurodollar bond with warrants in mid-July underwriting sources said A final official decision on the issue has yet to be made and detailed terms will be announced later they added The funds are likely to be used for investments to increase productivity both domestically and abroad they said officials said the worst may be over for the Japanese economy after today's news of stronger than expected growth in the January/March period But private economists were not so sure and said the economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 35 pct growth forecast in the current fiscal year ending next March As already reported GNP rose 12 pct in the January/March quarter after a revised 07 pct increase in the previous three months For the fiscal year that ended last March 31 GNP growth slowed to 26 pct from 43 pct in 1985/86 The government economists acknowledged that the improved export performance in the January/March quarter was unlikely to be repeated The volume of exports during the period was up two pct from the previous three months The yen's rise in April to about 140 to the dollar from 150 probably resulted in a fall in exports in the April/June quarter they said However given the yen's recent stability stepped-up domestic demand should work as a driving force to push the economy onto a path of sustainable growth they said Many private economists though doubt that the economy will achieve the government's 35 pct growth forecast for the 1987/88 year Growth in 1986/87 also fell short of the government's forecast which was revised downwards to three pct last December from an original four pct Domestic demand as a whole is not strong enough except for housing said Johsen Takahashi chief economist at Mitsubishi Research Institute Consumer spending is likely to remain weak as the growth in nominal income stays low he added The rise in consumer spending in the January-March quarter was simply a reflection of the contraction that occurred in the preceding three months Takahashi said Private capital spending in the quarter looked strong but this was primarily because utility companies brought forward their 1987/88 capital investment plans into the final quarter of 1986/87 in line with the government's economic stimulation package announced last fall he said Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank chief economist Kosaku Furuta said he was unable to say the economy has bottomed out but added he expects increasing signs of recovery in the coming months Destocking is coming to an end and companies are starting to rebuild inventories Furuta said Housing is expected to remain buoyant backed up by lower interest rates as well as government policies to stimulate the sector he said The government's recently unveiled 6000 billion yen economic package will also help the economy But he said that the economy was unlikely to achieve the government's 35 pct forecast for 1987/88 although growth might come close to three pct has no plans to liberalise its farm markets but will try to narrow the gap between the price of farm products at home and overseas Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato said He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade talks with the United States over rice Japan's staple food Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme example of protectionism and has demanded access for US Growers to the Japanese market This is closed to imports except in emergency Kato said Japanese farmers should however shed some blood to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice Price Council at which the government advisory body will discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need to cut subsidies worldwide Kato said Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect producers He said the United States spends some 258 billion dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export enhancement program and the EC 217 billion while Japan spends only 29 billion He said that although Japan provides the world's highest level of subsidies per acre its subsidy per farm family was several times lower than in the United States Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in US Congress he said Japan should make efforts to prevent farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a factor increasing protectionism in the United States Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's import restrictions on 12 farm items Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period from next April are due to start this autumn foreign shipbuilding orders received by Japanese yards in May fell to five vessels totalling 188900 gross tons (gt) from eight ships of 314000 gt in April against four ships of 104500 gt a year earlier the Japan Ship Exporters Association said The backlog of orders at end-May was 122 ships of 370 mln gt against 125 ships of 373 mln at end-April and 233 ships of 599 mln a year ago an association official said The world shipping recession and the yen's appreciation against the dollar depressed May orders he said of State George Shultz said the US Would erase its large foreign trade deficit faster than many predicted and the consequences for its trade partners might be traumatic The US Economy will inevitably make the adjustment necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in order to service our growing foreign debt he told a conference attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and their leading Western friends In my view this will happen more rapidly than many observers now predict The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is becoming less effective Shultz said It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the world to be a net exporter at the same time The US Deficit which we all decry has been in a sense the place into which everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on this deficit so something will have to give and it will be possibly a traumatic experience he added While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew protectionist policies you must act too Shultz said I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open their doors wider he told the group which included representatives from Australia Canada Japan New Zealand and the European Community Plc <BCSL> expects the global travellers cheque industry to grow three to six pct a year in the next five to 10 years despite growing competition from credit cards divisional manager KS Nicklin said He said the bank expected the size of the market to increase to between 39 and 40 billion dlrs in 1987 from 37 to 38 billion in 1986 because of worldwide economic recovery He said China the Gulf states South America and Japan would be areas for growth Middle-income groups in the US And Canada would continue to use travellers cheques for overseas trips rather than credit cards vehicle exports fell 93 pct in May from a year earlier to 531253 mainly because of lower exports to the US Industry sources said This compares with 633869 in April Official figures will be announced by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association later this month May exports included 374482 passenger cars down 99 pct from a year earlier and 156771 commercial vehicles down 43 pct the sources said But vehicle kit exports rose 313 pct to 154711 compared with 146610 in April May exports of kit parts included 115847 cars up 35 pct from a year earlier and 38864 commercial vehicles up 214 pct the industry sources said Japan's car production in May fell 11 pct from a year earlier to 574921 and commercial vehicle output fell 48 pct to 335460 while car kit output rose 297 pct from a year earlier

the Agriculture Ministry said The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising Ministry officials said Compound feed sales totalled 2601 mln tonnes in 1986/87 against 2540 mln a year ago while end-March stocks were 217554 tonnes against 224101 Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 1171 mln tonnes from 1102 mln a year earlier due to low import prices The officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced Chicago prices The corn compounding ratio rose to 452 pct in 1986/87 from 434 pct a year earlier Sorghum use rose marginally to 480 mln tonnes in 1986/87 from 479 mln but the compounding ratio fell to 185 pct from 189 pct because of greater corn use Higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum Soybean meal use fell to 258 mln tonnes from 263 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 100 pct from 103 pct The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal the officials said Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563889 tonnes against 528152 a year earlier The compounding ratio rose to 22 pct from 21 pct of the Bull Moose coking coal mine in British Columbia Canada agreed to cut the base price they charge Japanese steelmakers to 9177 Canadian dlrs a tonne FOB for the year from April 1 down 14 dlrs from 1986/87 an official at a company involved in the deal said The Nippon Kokan KK <NKKTT> official said the cut was agreed after five months of talks between <Teck Corp> <Rornex Mining Corp Ltd> and <Nissho Iwai Coal Development (Canada) Ltd> He said the Japanese side would continue to ask the miners to improve the quality of Bull Moose coal's ash specification Japanese steel mills and several Canadian exporters including the sellers of Bull Moose coal have had several rounds of negotiations on coking coal base prices this year industry sources said The Japanese steel firms started a new round of base price talks with <Quintette Coals Ltd> yesterday while discussions with <Gregg River Co

today's one-month commercial bill discount rate of 35625 pct and one-month certificate of deposit rate of 398/86 pct Traders estimate a 300 billion yen surplus due to tax allocations to local governments and public entities The operation will put outstanding bill supplies at about 2000 billion yen Volvo AB <VOLV ST> said its B-Free shares are to be listed on the Zurich Basle and Geneva bourses in the autumn The company said in a statement that the new listing would further expand the number of international bourses on which Volvo shares are quoted It is already quoted on stock exchanges in Sweden Britain West Germany France Belgium Norway and Tokyo and its shares are also traded over-the-counter in the United States Switzerland attracts us as one of the most international capital markets Lennart Jeansson of the Volvo board said A Swiss bank consortium led by Credit Suisse had carried out a secondary placement of 500000 B-Free Volvo shares on the Swiss market in preparation for Volvo's autumn entry onto the bourses Volvo said Finance Ministry is putting the finishing touches on a roughly 2000 billion yen supplementary budget for 1987/88 and has started to turn its attention to next year's main budget ministry officials said The supplementary budget is designed to help finance the 6000 billion yen emergency economic package the government unveiled last month to boost domestic demand Ministry officials said the government would issue about 1300 billion yen in construction bonds to help pay for the increased public investment set out in the emergency package The rest of the supplementary budget will be financed by 450 billion yen in proceeds from last year's sale of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) and by higher than expected 1986/87 tax revenues officials said One official said the carry-over of tax revenues into the 1987/88 fiscal year that began on April 1 might be more than 1000 billion yen Soaring land and share prices have boosted receipts especially from securities and land taxes With less than half of the carry-over likely to be used in the current supplementary budget the rest will be available for a second supplementary budget expected later this year The second supplementary budget will be used to finance the government's wage bill which will not be known until after wage talks later this year one official said The government must also finance the tax cut of more than 1000 billion yen which it promised in its emergency package but which will not be contained in the first supplementary budget due to be presented to parliament next month The Finance Ministry's budget bureau is hoping the tax carry-over and higher than expected revenues again this year will be enough to finance the second supplementary budget he said Officials said the Finance Ministry does not want to issue deficit-financing bonds or use the extra proceeds from this year's NTT share sale to fund the second supplementary budget Besides the first supplementary budget the government also intends to introduce a new tax reform bill to parliament during the upcoming extraordinary session officials said The government was forced to abandon its first tax reform bill due to strong opposition to its plan to introduce a five pct sales tax The sales tax was designed to help finance cuts in individual and corporate income taxes The new bill will present the 1000 billion yen-plus tax cut contained in the emergency package as the first step to an overhaul of the country's tax system officials said It will also contain a controversial plan to phase out tax breaks on savings although it may not take effect in October as originally planned they said Looking ahead to next year's main budget the Finance Ministry is beginning to debate whether to abandon its so-called minus ceiling for public investment That policy calls on government departments to cut public investment spending by five pct per year Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo said recently the policy would be suspended in 1988/89 pending a recommendation from the government's administrative reform council The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said in April that budget request guidelines for invesment expenditures would be reviewed But some officials at the Finance Ministry's budget bureau said they were hopeful the policy would be retained They fear that a suspension of the guidelines for public investment could lead to increased pressure on the government to loosen its grip on current expenditures as well The account would also extend interest-free loans to profitable public works projects developed in conjunction with the private sector the officials said In this way the Finance Ministry could meet growing pressure on it to boost capital spending while maintaining a tight grip on outlays by other government departments Surplus funds from this year's sale of NTT shares could total about 3000 billion yen Based on the current market price the planned sale of 195 mln shares would raise more than 5000 billion yen compared to about 2000 billion planned for in the main 1987/88 budget Motor Corp <TOYOT> and Nissan Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> both said May vehicle exports fell from a year earlier mainly due to the yen rise against the dollar Toyota's exports fell 95 pct from a year earlier to 161266 vehicles in May while Nissan's fell 176 pct to 100221 Toyota's exports to the US Fell 139 pct from a year earlier to 90096 in May and those to Europe fell 28 pct from a year earlier to 34876 Nissan's exports to

last year's levels despite the halt of shipments to the US Company spokesmen told They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting EC sanctions urged by European computer makers The Europeans feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the personal computer market in the EC the Sharp spokesman said Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers would continue at 5000 units a month for the time being Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top personal computers would continue at last year's level of 12000 to 16000 units a year Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged failure to uphold a 1986 agreement on semiconductor

Arab Heavy to 20 pct Arab Light under a term contract agreement with Aramco for 100000 barrels per day the sources said The contractual ratio is 30 pct heavy crude to 70 pct light Japanese demand for heavy crude oil has increased substantially since the All Japan Seaman's Union ceased sailing into the northern Mideast gulf last month causing problems with liftings of heavy Kuwait and Khafji crudes state oil company Pertamina has informed its affiliated Japanese companies that crude oil supplies will be 40 pct less than contractual volumes in July a spokesman for an affiliated company said He said the allocations were in line with Indonesia's production ceiling under its current OPEC quota so they might be increased if OPEC ratifies a production rise next week Allocations of Indonesia's main traded crude Minas had been cut by 50 pct and Duri by 38 pct he said Last month contractual volumes were cut by 30 pct Contractual volumes assume no production ceiling Oil traders said Indonesian grades were already trading above their official selling prices (osp) on the spot market due to strong demand from Japan and the US And tight supplies A cargo of Duri loading in July was reportedly traded yesterday at 70 cents over its osp of 1560 dlrs per barrel and Minas is trading about 20 cents higher they said Motor Corp <MAZTT> predicted a parent company current profit of 10 billion yen in the year ending October 31 1987 down 508 pct from a year earlier assuming a yen/dollar value at 147 yen vice president Yoshihiro Wada told a press conference Sales in 1986/87 were estimated at 1640 billion yen up 09 pct from a year earlier The company earlier posted a parent net profit of 159 billion in the first half ended April 30 down 769 pct from a year earlier on sales of 80402 billion down 42 pct The fall was due to the yen rise against the dollar which cut 55 billion yen off sales Wada said The average value of the dollar was 155 yen in the period from 190 a year earlier Mazda estimated vehicle exports at 112 mln including kit parts in the year to October 31 up 68 pct from a year earlier and domestic sales at 360000 up 08 pct he said Kit exports should rise because kits sold to Kia Motor Corp <KIAMSE> unit <Kia Industrial Corp> which is eight pct owned by Mazda and to a Mexico unit of Ford Motor Co <F> will rise to 150000 from 9000 pushing kit exports up 453 pct to 260000 he said Mazda has yet to decide whether to pay an unchanged four yen dividend for the second half but it will pay an unchanged 350 yen for the first half Wada said major Japanese institutional investors are gradually returning to investing in US Treasuries although fear that the dollar has not yet bottomed out has kept others cautiously waiting on the sidelines Trust banks and some investment trusts are starting to look at buying treasuries for short-term gains while other investment trusts and most life insurers are still wary according to fund managers polled by The five percentage point gap between US And Japanese long-term bonds is the major attraction of T-bonds Most institutions remain sensitive to the prospects of dollar declines after making huge foreign exchange losses on their foreign bond holdings last fiscal year ended March The seven leading local life insurers alone saw losses on their foreign bond holdings of over 1700 billion yen or some 115 billion dlrs in 1986/87 industry sources said However most institutional investors want to buy US T-bonds due to the absence of profitable domestic instruments Despite all the negative factors we have definite demand for US Securities said Osamu Fukushima deputy manager of Mitsui Trust and Banking Co Ltd's securities department Another trust bank fund manager said What matters the most are the fundamentals of the US Economy and the competitiveness of US Industry We are closely watching the growth of US Exports which is an important measure of the fundamental strength of the dollar The US Trade deficit's decline in April was due to a 12 billion dlr decline in imports while exports did not show a recovery he said One life insurance company fund manager said We doubt the US Government will fight the trade and fiscal deficits especially after the announcement of Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker's resignation The receptive stance of the US Congress on the call for further dollar falls to cut the country's trade deficit also makes us wary about US Bonds purchases the life insurance company fund manager said Yuji Miyaji deputy manager of the Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co Ltd's securities investment department said We are slowly starting to buy US Bonds because the gap of over 500 basis points between the US And Japan is very attractive However we are pessimistic on the dollar's further recovery We find that US Economic fundamentals have not changed so far Keijirou Fukushima manager at Yamaichi Investment Trust Management Co Ltd's bond portfolio management department said We would like to invest in US Bonds gradually given an improved inflation outlook and the limited chances of a further steep fall in the dollar from now We have already reduced forward dollar selling volume to 40 pct of our total foreign assets from 60 pct he said Another life insurance company fund manager said We have started investing in US Treasury securities but only on a trading basis Motor Co Ltd <HMCT> said its vehicle exports in May fell 114 pct from a year earlier to 54982 Honda shipped 34701 vehicles to the US In May up 44 pct from a year earlier but total

today to buy 350 mln dlrs in subordinated capital notes and preferred stock that it plans to issue to boost its equity base a company spokesman said BankAmerica vice chairman Frank N Newman held a meeting here today to outline its fund-raising plan to some 20 Japanese banks he told He also stressed the company's efforts to streamline operations by withdrawing from unprofitable energy-related areas to concentrate more on its Californian home base But Newman said the company had no intention of selling its Seafirst Corp Subsidiary in Washington A document obtained by shows the fund-raising effort involves 250 mln dlrs in 12-year subordinated capital notes and 100 mln in convertible preferred stock It has made a shelf registration with the SEC so that it can issue debt securities whenever market conditions are favorable The company already raised 100 mln dlrs in the US Market last month he added According to the document the 250 mln dlrs in subordinated capital notes will carry an interest rate of 100 basis points over the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) The minimum rate will be six pct and the maxiumum 12 pct The notes will be redeemable at par after four years and will also have warrants attached to purchase the firm's common stock at 1750 dlrs There will be 75 mln warrants in all with a term of 10 years The planned convertible preferred stock will carry a dividend rate equivalent to three months LIBOR plus an as yet undecided premium the document said There will be no sinking fund for the preferred stock which will have 10-year warrants attached to buy BankAmerica common stock The rest of the details of the preferred stock issue have yet to be worked out On both the preferred stock and note issues BankAmerica said that a fixed rate alternative was possible The document said that BankAmerica was also open to raising funds in yen if that was desirable for the Japanese Those present at the meeting today were working-level officials from 13 city three long-term credit and seven trust banks Japanese banking sources said Newman expressed hope that certain banks would act as lead managers of the projected debt securities but did not name specific banks the sources said No bank made any commitment to the company's fund-raising plan as most knew little about it in advance they said Today's meeting itself was held with very short-notice and we just can't decide what to do with it said a senior official at a leading city bank Newman attempted to quell Japanese bankers' fears that the US Federal Reserve may insist that they deduct the equivalent amount to the securities purchased from their primary capital under a regulation now being studied by the US And Britain Newman told them that they should not worry because he understood the US Federal Reserve would not go along with such a regulation the official said Motor Corp <MAZTT> said its vehicle exports fell 22 pct from a year earlier to 69191 in May In May exports included 50800 cars down 48 pct from a year earlier and 18391 commercial vehicles up six pct the company said Mazda's exports to the US Fell 78 pct to 35401 and those to Europe fell 26 pct to 20809 Exports to South East Asia rose 1424 pct to 6564 due to higher exports of complete kits to <Kia Industrial Corp> US Senators said they will propose a temporary ban on imports of all Toshiba products due to the company's illegal sales of sensitive high-technology goods to the Soviet Union Senator Jake Garn John Heinz and Richard Selby said at a hearing of the senate banking committee on export control they will offer the proposal as part of a major trade bill when it is brought before the senate this summer Garn a Utah Republican said I am talking about specific retribution on a company that endangers the security of their own country and ours European Community (EC) accused the United States of violating a political commitment to free trade through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a customs user fee EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which import licenses have been temporarily suspended so as to improve its balance of payments The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules by restricting imports of agricultural products through an import licensing system The United States asked for consultations with Tokyo on the issue Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to negotiate freer trade in 13 areas they set up the GATT surveillance body to monitor this commitment known in GATT jargon as standstill and rollback Tran criticised Washington for the superfund tax on oil imports a customs user fee and the removal of a special machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government procurement list for reasons of national security Warren Lavorel a US Trade official defended the policies saying they did not violate GATT trade rules The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks to the Trade Negotiating Committee which oversees the round to decide any further action on the charges The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's report and ruled that the US Superfund tax on oil imports breached trade rules It called on Washington to modify its legislation Mexico and Canada along with the European Community brought the dispute to the GATT last year trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987 as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988 thus weakening the international adjustment process It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 33 pct in 1987 and 36 pct in 1988 As a result the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986 although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan However OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through and thus will provide some stimulus to imports The OECD outlook said Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988 below 1986's 25 pct growth But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 06 pct rise in consumer prices last year for world economic growth remain very sluggish and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence stabilize currencies and encourage investment the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months and  Slow growth high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 225 pct both this year and next even slower than last year's 25 pct growth rate We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct David Henderson head of the OECD's economics and statistics department said The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the US Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn At the same time many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable it said citing low inflation in most major countries healthy corporate finances generally lower interest rates improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates it said and warned that for confidence to be restored it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada analysts said The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence and called on more active fiscal policies from the US West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the US And raise it in the other two countries Henderson said the 6000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process though it was too early to estimate its precise impact He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic demand significantly quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP The inflation outlook while broadly satisfactory has worsened in recent months with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 35 pct this year and 375 pct in 1988 after a 28 pct increase in 1986 There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months with the average rate expected to stabilize at 825 pct similar to last year The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers
