# ReutersDataMining

This was a rather slapdash blitz analysis of a data set of old Reuters articles for learning basic concepts of data mining. You'll see the data and many scripts for cleaning and classifying data are included. 

Input data was in XML format. Multiple attempts were made in classifying the data in different ways, naive bayes, k-means, DBSCAN, and others. Much new information was pulled from these mines and is reported on in the labs 1, 2, and 3 report documents.

No plans to go back to this currently, although it would be fun to clean up the code and run additional analyses on it. In the rush of finishing the projects, curiosity got a bit neglected.
