id,textalgeria,US crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said merchant bank Mediobanca Spa <MDBIMI> said an Italian banking consortium has arranged 100 mln dlrs in financing for Banque Exterieure d'Algerie Mediobanca said in a statement that the financing was part of an accord reached last March between Italy and Algeria which agreed 300 mln dlrs of financing for Italian exports to Algeria Mediobanca said 12 Italian banks were participating in the consortium but gave no further details about the financing Among the banks are Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BANIMI> Banco di Sicilia and Efibanca Spa are that USDA accepted Algeria's bid for

argentina,Japanese commercial creditor banks confirmed an earlier commitment to extend some 360 mln dlrs in new loans to Argentina banking sources said The commitment will represent a part of the 195 billion dlrs in new loans to Argentina agreed to by 350 banks worldwide last April 24 the sources said The 350 banks were supposed to confirm their Argentina loan commitments by June 17 About 91 pct of them have already done so but it may take some more time before all have confirmed their intentions the sources added President Raul Alfonsin met for more than an hour with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Argentine economy minister Juan Sourrouille said the two men discussed Argentina's economy and its commercial bank financing package Sourrouille told reporters that 915 pct of the 195 billion dlr loan which forms the core of the package has been subscribed Citibank the chairman of Argentina's bank advisory committee said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91 pct The IMF has said that a critical mass of bank commitments is needed before it will start disbursing the 183 billion dlr standby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass Sourrouille said That has not been defined but anywhere over 90 pct we are doing fine Although most of the money has been subscribed officials noted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold 93 pct of its debt They are worried that it might take a long time to persuade the other banks to join the deal Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus who had not met before mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic situation Alfonsin who is beginning a four-day private visit to the US was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World Affairs Council a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing public awareness of international affairs In his speech Alfonsin said economic integration is the only way for Latin America to overcome its current crisis This (economic integration) is probably the most audacious challenge facing Latin America this century perhaps the most audacious of our history he said Economy Minister Juan Sourrouille left at the weekend for the United States for talks with creditor banks and the IMF aimed at obtaining the release of new loans the semi-official news agency Telam said It said Sourrouille would urge the IMF to release a 480 mln dlrs compensatory loan for falling exports as well as the first two tranches of a standby loan totalling 450 mln dlrs Release of the funds from the standby loan has been delayed by Argentina's failure to win final approval to a 195 billion dlr loan from creditor banks which was a condition for the IMF disbursement Banks have pledged 97 pct of the 195 billion dlr loan but the IMF has not yet defined what amount constitutes the critical mass which is needed for release of the IMF funds and the funds from creditor banks The president of Argentina's bank steering committee William Rhodes of Citibank said on Friday he thought the loan agreement with Argentina could be signed in August European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said agriculture secretariat set new support prices for grains and oilseeds an official statement said It said the support price for wheat was hiked to 300 Australs per tonne from 250 previously and for sunflowerseed from northwestern Argentina to 450 Australs from 360 previously It said the price went into effect Monday The secretariat said the support price of sorghum was increased to 210 Australs per tonne from 200 Australs previously and for maize to 250 Australs from 220 Australs previously US is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the US National Soybean Processors Association US officials said The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the US Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market said one US source The US shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July the differential was narrowed only one pct Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88 As a result of the impasse the US is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather the US sources said A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan administration soon they said 
australia,Australia's economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 25 pct this year and by 275 pct in 1988 compared with only 14 pct in 1986 The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages it added The report forecasts a decline in inflation with consumer prices increasing by 85 pct this year and 625 pct in 1988 The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988 While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year however the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 375 pct The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis The country's GDP which contracted by 06 pct last year should again show growth over the next two years rising by 025 pct this year and a more substantial 275 pct in 1988 Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd <ANZAS> said it will cut its prime rate to 1600 pct from 1650 effective June 22 The cut takes the ANZ's prime to the lower end of the range of prime rates being offered by Australian trading banks The highest rate is 1750 pct The cut follows announcements of cuts yesterday by <Citibank Ltd> to 1600 pct from 165 effective today and <Commonwealth Bank of Australia> to 1575 pct from 1625 effective June 24 conservative opposition already fighting an uphill election battle now faces controversy in its own ranks over a possible error in its major tax cutting program economists said Professor Michael Porter architect of the tax plan declined to refute Treasurer Paul Keating's charge that the opposition miscalculated tax and expenditure cuts by several billion dollars Economists said the opposition trailing behind Labour in opinion polls would find its chances further diminished if its tax policy was a miscalculation The tax plan unveiled by opposition leader John Howard last week is the cornerstone of the Liberal Party's economic strategy to oust the Labour Party in the July 11 poll Keating has said the Howard tax plan would sharply increase the budget deficit to more than nine billion dlrs and severely damage Australia's economy already overburdened with balance of payments and foreign debt problems In his mini-budget on May 13 Keating said the budget deficit for the year ending June 1988 would be between two and three billion dlrs Porter a key member of the opposition economic think tank said he played a leading role in formulating the tax plan but not Howard's proposed expenditure savings which Keating claimed were distorted through double counting Some opposition members said there appeared to be errors but a Liberal Party spokesman refused comment saying the package was being reexamined The whole thing is so deceitful Prime Minister Bob Hawke said in a radio interview Howard has made a mess of it If they can't govern themselves how can they expect to govern the country? Hawke who is seeking a third term said the opposition had made the election one of the easiest for him I've never felt more physically and mentally relaxed (during an election) We've no problems at all he said The latest public opinion poll published in the Melbourne Sun newspaper showed Labour was leading the opposition by 12 points indicating a 66-seat majority for Hawke in parliament The Election Commission announced last night that 613 candidates would contest the 148-seat House of Representatives while 255 candidates would fight for the 76 Senate seats World Bank is issuing a 100 mln Australian dlr bond due July 20 1992 paying 13-3/8 pct and priced at 101-7/8 pct lead manager Hambros Bank Ltd said The non-callable bond is available in denominations of 1000 and 10000 Australian dlrs and will be listed in Luxembourg The selling concession is 1-1/4 pct while management and underwriting combined pays 5/8 pct The payment date is July 20 Agriculture Department inspectors have refused entry to parts of two lots of Australian beef because of pesticide residues a spokeswoman for the department said She said USDA has notified Australia which assured it that stricter controls would be implemented The Australian government had already imposed residue controls and it is believed the meat with the presticide residues was already in the pipeline before the controls were put in place the spokeswoman said There have been five other cases of Australian meat which had residue levels above US allowable limits this year she said Ltd <STOSS> said it had made a significant oil discovery at its Mawson One well in the Moomba block of the Cooper Basin South Australia It said the well flowed oil from sands at an average rate of 1440 barrels per day from 2131 to 2135 metres through a 6mm choke Santos said the well was cased and suspended pending further evaluation But it said the proximity of the discovery to existing production facilities at the Gidgealpa South field would allow Mawson One to be brought into production rapidly Santos has a 60 pct stake in the block <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd> has 30 pct and <South Australian Oil and Gas Corp Pty Ltd> has 10 pct Motor Corp <MAZTT> has signed an agreement to import coal from <Coalex Pty Ltd> of Australia through Sumitomo Corp <SUMTT> a Mazda spokesman said Under the agreement Mazda will annually import 144000 tonnes of Australian coal worth about nine billion yen The coal will be used as fuel for Mazda's energy centre due to start operations in November at its main plant in Hiroshima in western Japan he said He declined to specify the term of the contract but added that such contracts are usually for long periods major benefits of BHP Steel International Group's big capital expenditure program should begin to be seen in its 1988 financial year ending next May 31 Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKNS> officials said A decline in BHP Steel's net profit to 20002 mln dlrs in the 1987 year ended May 31 1987 from 25387 mln the year before contributed to the drop in attributable group earnings to 82027 mln dlrs from 98820 mln We look forward to a 1988 year of consolidation while continuing our strong business development initiatives BHP Steel chief executive officer David Rice told reporters Rice said BHP Steel's capital spending in 1987 totalled 701 mln dlrs and that total expenditure would be about 14 billion dlrs by the time the government's five-year Steel Industry Plan expires at the end of calendar 1988 He said the investment program aimed at making BHP Steel both technically and commercially competitive on a world scale was now over its peak and would begin to scale down Operational and commissioning problems flowing from the investment program combined with the highest levels of industrial action since the steel plan started had contributed to the decline in 1987 earnings he said Rice said the industrial and production problems forced BHP Steel to import 280000 tonnes of steel in its 1987 financial year to keep faith with customers The new items of plant are now past their initial teething problems and talks have intensified with the unions on the industrial troubles he said Despite the profit drop in the 1987 year BHP Steel International group was one of the most profitable steel producers in the world on an after-tax basis he said Its capacity utilisation was far higher at 89 pct than the current western world average of 69 pct he added and Australia's Victoria state signed a joint venture contract for a 290 mln dlr aluminium processing plant in China that will export to South Korea Australian officials told journalists China has no official direct trade or government ties with Seoul while it maintains close links with North Korea China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) would have 75 pct of the equity in <Bohai Aluminium Industries Ltd> the company to build the rolling mill and extrusion plant on the northeast China coast they said It was China's largest joint venture so far they said A joint venture opens up the potential for penetrating markets that would not otherwise be possible (for China) Victoria state treasurer Rob Jolly said An Australian diplomat said CITIC was eager to pursue South Korean markets Indirect trade between China and Seoul is growing but is not officially publicised Victoria's <Aluvic Ltd> on behalf of the state government will hold a 25 pct equity stake in the project which is intended as a sister plant to Victoria's Portland aluminium smelter CITIC in May agreed to invest about 80 mln dlrs in Portland The China-based joint venture would process Portland aluminium and aim to sell aluminium products to the domestic Chinese market as well as for export Jolly said The Australian side's investment was limited to about 22 mln dlrs but Aluvic would have the right to appoint key managers he said Australian officials said they hoped the goodwill generated by their participation would lead to further CITIC investment in Victoria The Chinese group enjoys a high level of independence from Peking's central government and has extensive overseas investments

farmers Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform the EC Common Agricultural Policy and US Plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction I am hopefully optimistic There is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the USA the EC and the Cairns Group he told reporters Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks on farm subsidies The group which includes Australia and Malaysia advocates free farm trade and says US European and Japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in North and South America the EC and Thailand and leaves for Indonesia on Wednesday Minister for Trade Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major agricultural producers to which Australia and Thailand belong has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral trade talks There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other international trade negotiations he said Duffy here on a three-day visit after talks in the United States The European Community (EC) and Latin America said considerable progress has been made by the group towards fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed countries The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a determination to resist the currently strong protectionist sentiment in the US Congress 
austria,Cold and wet weather in northern western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year are extracts from the communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference here The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive results of the agreement signed in December 1986 by which OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18 dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings distributed into national production levels The conference noted that all market indicators including spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC crudes have been firming up significantly thus consolidating the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the second half of the year and decided that in order to secure continued firm prices in the market OPEC production during the fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third quarter IE 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) distributed into the same national production levels as were defined by the above-mentioned agreement for that quarter Furthermore the conference decided to establish a committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices in order to secure price stability around the opec price structure Should there be any significant change in market prices the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the year which would secure the desired market stability The conference reiterated the necessity of member countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December 1986 both in terms of official price and national production levels For this purpose the conference decided to establish a committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the terms of the agreement Moreover the conference stressed the necessity of the cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market stability The conference therefore decided to reinstate the group of five heads of delegation established by the 77th (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April 1986 to undertake the necessary contacts with those countries The conference observed the continued fall in the value of the US Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied and reported to the next meeting of the conference The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next ordinary meeting The conference extended the term of office of Fadhil al-Chalabi as deputy secretary general for a period of one year from October 7 1987 The next ordinary meeting of the conference will be convened in Vienna on December 9 1987 output for the second half of 1987 including that of Iraq will be above the official 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said Iraq refused to sign the pact by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 166 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987 In December OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 183 mln bpd now cut back to the third quarter target Ali told a news conference that including Iraq OPEC third quarter output will be between 175 and 177 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices Iraq has an official first half quota of 1466 mln bpd rising to 154 mln in the second half but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran which has a quota of 2255 mln bpd rising to 2369 mln in the second half Ali said the position of the 400000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude was fixed We will not discuss it There will not be any change he said Ali said the conference which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting We sweep a lot under the carpet he said Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting Ali said The problem of differentials is a real one I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9 Ali said If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue I will not do the work of another minister Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1 with a spread of 265 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes and West on Monday decided to go ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Representatives of the US The Soviet Union the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants but by joining them Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich West Germany and is scheduled for completion by 1990 an IAEA statement said Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries Dieter Sigmar a leading US Fusion researcher said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste While today's nuclear power plants need uranium mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water according to experts of the Chamber of Commerce's Money and Credit section Hellmuth Klauhs said the government should guarantee any company debts arising from the planned restructuring of the public sector Klauhs said that there was no doubt that the government would meet its obligations But the owner should say this clearly once again he added Klauhs said 35 billion of 61 billion schillings owed by firms under the state holding <Oesterreichische Industrieholding AG> (OIAG) currently had no formal state guarantee Nine of the 35 billion schillings were owed to foreign banks Klauhs also managing director of <Genossenschaftliche Zentralbank AG> said banking industry officials would discuss the issue with finance minister Ferdinand Lacina next month Lacina said last week a special guarantee would be unnecessary as state industry had the financial power and enough liquidity to pay its debts The government has said the latest injection of state funds into OIAG to cover losses will be the last Under a restructuring plan OIAG is to

bahrain,Kuwait whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on certificates of deposit (CDs) issued today by the United Arab Emirates central bank were unchanged from those on last Monday's offer the bank said The one month yield was set at last week's 6-3/4 pct while two and three month CDs also remained unchanged at 6-13/16 pct The six month yield was set at seven pct 19 commercial banks have been instructed by the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) to return to a six day working week with effect from July 4 A circular sent to the banks today reverses a shift in early April to a five day week and follows three months of controversy within the domestic banking sector over hours A BMA spokesman said the circular which does not affect offshore banks represented a compromise solution between differing views within the industry and was drawn up following the agency's own survey of banks staff and customers In April the BMA allowed commercial banks to operate a five day week from Sunday to Thursday Banks have since been closed on Fridays the Islamic weekend and Saturdays The new regulation will require banks to work from 730 AM To 12 noon from Saturday to Thursday inclusive Banks may open on these days during the afternoon between 330 and 530 The regulations apply to bank opening hours not to staff working hours which continue to be decided by banks Under the five day week introduced in early April banks have been obliged to open from 8 AM Until noon and from 330 to 530 PM Iranian shuttle tanker reported spotting a floating mine in the central Gulf on Tuesday about 50 miles west of Lavan Island regional shipping sources said The Khark

territorial waters of Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) in Bahrain rose 11 pct in the second quarter of 1987 to reach the highest level since early 1985 Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA) figures show The BMA's quarterly statistical bulletin gave no reason for the sharp rise but economists said banks appeared to be staying liquid because of the escalation of the Gulf crisis They said banks are parking funds in interbank markets outside Bahrain Despite the rise in assets banks in Bahrain have been retrenching operations considerably At the end of 1986 there were 68 OBUs compared with 74 at the end of 1985 BMA figures show OBU assets rose to 5830 billion dlrs at the end of June from 5253 billion at the end of March and 5568 billion at the end of 1986 The mid-1987 figure was the highest since early 1985 when assets topped 61 billion The second quarter rise came almost entirely in OBU assets outside Bahrain The volume of loans to the non-bank sector declined slightly indicating a still sluggish economy in the region economists said Assets of commercial banks in Bahrain were slightly lower at the end of the second quarter at 205 billion dinars compared with 210 billion at the end of

route for the Gulf would stay out for the time being following Monday's US Action But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the area Iran having vowed to react strongly after Monday's US Action launched a barrage of threats and ridicule For its part Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that it was ready for any further hostile action Pentagon officials then announced that a US Guided missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying the US flag southwards--the 80000 tonne product carrier Ocean City and 46000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night One of them sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield was all but blown out of the water by US Warships on Monday The Iranian platform an unsightly mass of steel and concrete was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four US Destroyers pumped some 1000 shells into it The US Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained US helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and US forces attacked seized and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines But Iran was not deterred according to US defense officials who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a US-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran Henry Schuler a former US diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of US intervention and Iran's response The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a US tit-for-tat policy that gave Iran the initiative said Harlan Ullman an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS He said with this appraoch America would suffer the death of one thousand cuts But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass Schuler said He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table If vital supplies were cut off Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980 Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties Each side has attacked the others' shipping US attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies Western diplomats in the region said US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that US Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday We consider the matter closed he said a signal the US administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis saying military action would endanger American interests Following the raid a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a crushing blow The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely Tehran Radio quoted him as saying Diplomats noted however Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering they said The ball is in Iran's court now It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other a diplomat said President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation one diplomat said This was better for US Relations with the Gulf Arab states particularly Kuwait Commented another diplomat: Kuwait must be happy that the US Has done something but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep One source said of the attack on the oil platform: They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody A diplomat commented: They were very clever in the place they chose It gets attention but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: This was a good measured response without risking a flare-up  It is a face-saving response (for the Americans) Energy Secretary John Herrington arrived in Rabat on Monday after a tour of the Gulf and the Middle East Herrington who is scheduled to meet King Hassan during his 24-hour official visit said on arrival he would discuss regional and international issues with Moroccan leaders Morocco is the last stop of a tour that has taken Herrington to Iraq Kuwait Qatar Bahrain Saudi Arabia and Egypt jets attacked three Iranian oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday setting at least one of them ablaze regional shipping sources said Earlier today in Washington US Television networks had reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms and setting them ablaze The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan Rostam and Rakhsh offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a wave of jet fighter bombers Smoke was seen spiralling up from the Rostam field soon after At least one of the other two targets was also believed to be ablaze the sources said The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi air strikes in the past but Baghdad had not reported any southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway US Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a US-flagged ship President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the US Response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was jets raided three Iranian oil rigs in the southern Gulf on Monday setting at least one of them ablaze regional shipping sources said

belgium,A meeting of European Community (EC) farm ministers is unlikely to be held next week following the ministers' failure to agree a 1987/88 farm price package yesterday an EC Commission spokesman said However he said he could not rule out such a meeting altogether noting the decision is one for Belgium which currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with the meeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and 30 diplomats noted The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourg still split on the question of an oils and fats tax and with West Germany saying it would use its veto on two other key aspects of EC Commission proposals the actual common price changes and a revision of the green money system The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely to appear in the EC's Official Journal within a few days giving notice of the Commission's intention to take emergency measures from July 1 should ministers fail to reach an accord However Commission sources said this notice would not detail the measures to be taken which they said might be considered by the Commission at its regular weekly meeting next Wednesday The Commission published a declaration by EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen made in Luxembourg early yesterday at the end of the agriculture ministers' meeting In it Andriessen said there was now a serious threat to the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy Andriessen added The CommissionWill take the measures which are necessary not only for the temporary management of the markets but also for a healthy finance policy This means that the protective measures we are going to apply will necessarily have in the context of our own powers a dynamic character he said 24-hour strike by Belgian public employees protesting against a government pay offer disrupted transport and hit ferry services and shipping port and union officials said Some cross-Channel ferry services from Ostend were cancelled the local news agency Belga said An Antwerp port authority spokesman said electricians came out in support reducing ship movements to a trickle Unions said Ghent and other major Belgian ports were also hit Few trains were running and some early morning flights by Sabena Belgian's national airline were cancelled Technologies Ltd said it formed a joint venture with the Regional Investment Co of the Wallon Region a Belgian government-controlled investment company It said the agreement is subject to approval of the Israeli Controller of Foreign Exchange Under the agreement OSHAP will establish a new corporation which will own all of OSHAP's operations in Europe including its manufacturing facility in Antwerp Belgium and distribution rights to OSHAP's other products in Europe The newly formed company will acquire from the Regional Investment Co of the Walloon Region (SPIW) about 88 pct of Pegard Productics SA and SPIW will be entitled to receive for its interest in Pegard about 37 pct of the outstanding shares of the new company In addition if the National Investment Co of Belgium a Belgium government controlled investment company chooses to participate in the transaction it will be entitled to receive a 47 pct stake in the new company for its 12 pct interest in Pegard Minister Mark Eyskens is proposing a package of personal income tax cuts worth 1021 billion francs that would apply from 1989 a finance ministry spokesman said The package one of 11 possible tax reform scenarios drawn up by government officials is expected to be discussed by ministers in the coming weeks so that a government draft can be presented to parliament in October The proposals which would greatly simplify the country's tax system include a cut in withholding tax on investment income earned in Belgium to 20 pct from the current 25 pct The reduction would apply to income from risk capital but the spokesman said this was likely to be defined to include all shares and bonds The package chosen by Eyskens is more favourable to families with children than the present regime and would treat spouses' incomes separately instead of combining them a practice that is widely seen as discouraging marriage The tax reform does not encompass corporate taxation The spokesman said some 75 pct of the cost of the package would be financed by changes to the 258 tax allowances currently granted to diverse interest groups A further 14 pct would be met by higher tax revenues resulting from the overall macro-economic benefits of the package This would leave a shortfall of around 20 billion francs which the government would have to decide how to cover either by raising indirect taxes or by making further budgetary cuts The package favoured by Eyskens who has described Belgium as a fiscal Himalaya is the least costly of the 11 scenarios prepared It envisages three marginal rates or tax thresholds of 30 pct 40 pct and 50 pct This compares with 13 currently of which the highest is 716 pct and wet weather in northern western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year is to urge fellow tin producing countries to contribute more money towards research into new uses for the metal Malaysian primary industries minister Lim Keng Yaik told in an interview Lim in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America said he had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC to draw up a paper on the matter Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated he feared the Commission would revive the idea Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports Since most of our products are commodity based I cannot see how this would work out in our case Lim said Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium paper and plastics Lim said He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement INRA although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited Lim who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's behalf when he visits New York during his current tour said it was important there should not be a long interregnum between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management current holder of the European Community presidency appears ready to drop a controversial oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price package diplomats said In a discussion document prepared for today's summit meeting of EC leaders Belgium proposed the so-called stabilising mechanism be the subject of further study and consultation with the Community's main trading partners The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism The discussion document aimed at preventing a cash row at the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price talks contained the first formal reference to dropping the measure Britain and Denmark which assumes the EC presidency on June 30 have led the opposition to the measure They are supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and to a lesser extent Spain Although the paper was not universally welcomed diplomats said the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a further six months was certain to survive any redrafting talks last week between the European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next month diplomatic sources said The US Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy taking an increasing share of the US Pasta market The sources said the EC which currently provides subsidies of around 16 cents a pound offered a compromise in last week's talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the US US Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline for agreement set last August when the two sides resolved a related dispute over EC restrictions on US Citrus imports The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly It was also possible the US Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta lifted when the citrus row was settled But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10 Community agriculture ministers will meet tomorrow evening after the end of a two-day summit meeting of heads of government to again attempt to agree a 1987/88 farm price package an EC Commission spokesman said He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain notice of special agricultural measures of a purely technical nature which will come into effect on July 1 unless the ministers reach an accord The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but said they would not be the sort of dynamic moves which EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen has said he would take in the case of complete deadlock among farm ministers These moves would be taken only if tomorrow's meeting of ministers in Brussels again fails to reach an accord EC sources said Andriessen is thought to be prepared to cut cereals prices by seven pct and to take other drastic action trade sources said EC farm ministers ended their last meeting on June 18 still split over the Commission's proposal for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats In addition West Germany said it would veto plans for cereal price cuts and for a change in the green currency system Earlier today diplomats said Belgium the current holder of the European Community presidency appears ready to drop the plans for the controversial oils and fats tax between the European Community (EC) and the United States have failed to settle a trade dispute over pasta an EC Commission spokesman said Diplomatic sources said the dispute could provoke new trade friction unless it was settled soon Washington is insisting that the EC comply with what it regards as an unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and cut export subsidies which have allowed Italy to take an increasing share of the US pasta market The EC provides subsidies of about 16 cents a pound on pasta exports The spokeswoman said the talks foundered on the question of how much the subsidy should be cut specially convened Franco-German meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies diplomats said The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community's worst-ever budget crisis The Germans clearly do not want to budge an aide to Chirac told reporters He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex green currrency system designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against along with Britain Denmark and the Netherlands EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group and plugging a 57 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987 thriving market in Luxembourg franc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the Belgian government crisis which has put the franc under pressure and forced up interest rates banking sources said On Monday King Baudouin accepted the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens' coalition and asked him to try to form a new government Because of the crisis Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA (BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg francs originally scheduled for the end of last week BGL director Robert Sharfe said He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest rates on Luxembourg franc bond private placements banking sources said However no new placements are scheduled for another 10 days The latest issue last Friday for Swedish Export Credit Corp (SEK) carried a coupon of 7-1/2 pct whereas in previous issues the interest was set lower at 7-3/8 pct Interest rates on the Luxembourg franc which is in parity with the Belgian franc are strongly affected by Belgian rates On Friday Belgium increased the rate on three-month Treasury certificates by 05 pct to 715 pct as the Belgian franc came under pressure Private placements in Luxembourg francs have become increasingly popular particularly with Scandivanian borrowers because they carry a relatively low interest rate Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc bond issues because the franc was seen as a fairly strong currency Baudouin is expected to accept the resignation of Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens's centre-right coalition government after last-ditch talks failed to solve a language row state-run RTBF radio said The King could ask Martens or another political leader to put together a new government or to form a caretaker administration with elections at the end of November or in early December The King has so far withheld a decision on whether to accept the resignation last Thursday of Martens's coalition of Dutch and French speaking parties over the linguistic conflict Martens has used the breathing space to try to put together a compromise solution but RTBF and the Belgian news agency Belga said leading ministers ended their talks early on Monday morning without agreement The resignation of the government will no doubt be accepted by the King in the near future RTBF said The King has no formal deadline for announcing his decision but has been widely expected to do so on Monday

brazil,The ruling Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) will hold a national convention on July 18 and 19 to discuss the length of the Presidential term a PMDB spokesman said Although the country's constitution allows for a six-year term Sarney said he would remain only five years after he came to power in 1984 The Constituent Assembly is drawing up a new constitution and severe economic problems have increased the pressure on it to call early elections A faction of the PMDB favours a poll in November next year cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said Japan will invest 24 billion yen in <PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium> in addition to the 683 billion yen already invested in the company The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment he said They will also provide equal shares in 63 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil in addition to the 457 billion yen already invested The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct the official said Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct but an agreement has yet to be reached industry sources said Under the rescue scheme for Asahan in which 911 billion yen has been invested Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 65 billion yen in Albras in which investment now totals 932 billion yen but its stake will not change from 51 pct the official said The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected reflecting Japan's desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand which totals some 18 mln tonnes a year they said coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added has bought 75000 tonnes of French wheat at tender a Brazilian Wheat Board spokesman said He said the Board accepted offers for 25000 tonnes of wheat from grain firm J Souffle at 8049 dlrs per tonne Fob for August shipment For September shipment the Board bought 25000 tonnes from Graniere at 7932 dlrs per tonne Fob and for October shipment it accepted 25000 tonnes from Andre and Companie at 7947 dlrs per tonne Fob The next tender for Aug/Sept/Oct shipment was set for June 24 the spokesman said group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress saying it would curb their exports slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt Mario Rodriguez Montero president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto Rodriguez said as yet the administration is not in a veto frame of mind US government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers Jon Rosenbaum an assistant US trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas There is one country which evidently still does not Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas head of the Colombian coffee producers federation who was in Europe Cardenas left a positive letter Rosenbaum said The Cardenas letter responded to a US letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement The US has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless objective criteria which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits crisis-ridden motor industry -- which is dominated by the subsidiaries of Volkswagen AG <VOWGF> Fiat Spa <FIATMI> General Motor Corp <GM> and Ford Co <F> -- has not made a single domestic sale for the last four days and several assembly lines will stop shortly industry spokesmen said The motor manufacturers have been feeling the pinch for months with demand slumping as the country heads into recession But the industry hit a fresh problem when dealers decided on Tuesday to stop buying any cars or trucks to protest high government taxes on vehicles The dealers' decision was sparked by a 33 pct increase in car prices authorized last week by the government to cover industry's rising costs Spokesman Marcio Stefani of the Brazilian Association of Autmotive Vehicle Distributors said dealers felt their livelihood was at stake -- cars aren't selling because they cost too much It is a question of our survival The price of cars in Brazil has reached an insupportable level he said A GM Opala Diplomata he said costs 30000 dlrs in Brazil while an equivalent car in the United States would cost about 10000 dlrs The National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers said that if the trade's boycott continues for another week consequences will be serious Association spokesman Fred Carvalho told The consequences will first of all be collective holidays then lay-offs and a more and more catastrophic situation A spokesman for Ford Brasil said it would tell about half of its 21000 workforce to take holidays June 29-July 13 Fiat announced yesterday that it would give 2000 workers a month's holiday from July 6 halting production for the domestic market Carvalho said the industry was working at 3500 vehicles a day below its 1986 average of 4700 and capacity of 5100 During last year's Cruzado Plan price freeze feverish demand far outstripped supply The industry says it could have sold many more cars than it produced but was constrained by a lack of parts Today the picture is completely different after months of raging inflation and demand has all but disappeared Carvalho said the government taxes on cars added 138 pct to the cost of the vehicle He described the taxes as the highest in the universe and the galaxy Domestic car sales during the first five months of this year slipped to their lowest level for a decade 241632 units compared with 382182 units during the same period last year On the bright side exports are booming -- sales abroad in May totalled 242 mln dlrs a record figure The motor industry is critical of the government of President Jose Sarney which has gained a reputation as an indifferent manager of the economy Last month Volkswagen said it was postponing indefinitely investments of 150 mln dlrs planned for this year Wolfgang Sauer president of Volkswagen do Brasil said the government had created a crisis of confidence Brazil's motor industry employs more than 150000 people US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said the US Government is disregarding the future of its economy and could within three to five years find itself on a situation similar to those of indebted Latin American countries The United States will not be able to service its debt without austerity he told a news conference The former secretary also criticised his country's foreign policy We have so many problems of our own at home that we should not be sending people like me and many others around the world to tell other countries how to handle their problems Kissinger came to Brazil on a private visit to make the opening speech at the Sixth World Congress of the International Federation of Purchasing and Materials Management to be held here June 24 through 26 During his visit he is to call on President Jose Sarney Foreign Minister Roberto Abreu Sodre Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira and Chamber of Deputies chairman Ulysses Guimaraes Monday in Brasilia Asked to comment on the economic measures imposed by the Brazilian government last week which included a new price freeze up to 90 days Kissinger said: I have only read a summary of the plan In principle it seems like a reasonable plan which could succeed and lead to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund coffee exports could amount to 19 mln bags this year because of the excellent crop estimate of 352 mln bags an IBC spokesman said He said exports could surpass the average annual 18 mln bags mark especially if the final harvest to be conducted in October and November confirms the crop at over 35 mln bags He said the average limit of errors for the official crop harvest could be set at five pct above or below the first estimates officially published today He said the IBC agreed with a request by producers for the Institute to ask the government for a monthly indexation of the guarantee minimum price motor industry facing the worst crisis of its history today sent thousands of workers on collective leave because of a sharp drop in demand Company spokesmen said Autolatina which last Friday laid off 4000 workers sent nearly 9000 of its 56500 employees in Brazil on collective leave until July 12 General Motors do Brasil said it would give 10 days' leave to part of its 22000 workforce from Wednesday Fiat is giving 2000 workers a month's holiday from July 6 Jacy Mendonca industrial relations director of Autolatina a merger of Volkswagen and Ford in Brazil and Argentina said last week this would be the worst year ever for Brazil's auto industry He forecast that 1987 would be worse than 1981 when domestic sales dropped 40 pct to 580000 units This year we'll be lucky if we can sell 550000 units he said Since Friday there have been two positive developments for the industry The government announced that it was scrapping a 15 pct surcharge on all new car sales The surcharge created in July last year was originally set at 30 pct to help curb a car-buying boom and was in theory refundable Brazilian car distributors which since June 16 had halted all car purchases in protest against high government taxes responded to the government move by resuming purchases But industry spokesmen said taxes on vehicles were still high 108 pct and the sector still faced major problems countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional Dauster a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here told journalists When consumers want to get involved talks are much more difficult The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries We have sacrificed a great deal already he said this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours World Bank said it approved a 100 mln dlr loan to help Brazil finance the rehabilitation of the railway in Sao Paulo State and establish a institutional reform program as a base for future commercial operation The 285 mln dlr project is designed to financially rehabilitate the railway -- the primarily state-owned Ferrovia Paulista SA -- and improve transportation on the lines leading to the city of Sao Paulo and the port of Santos The loan is for 14-years including three and one-half years of grace and carries a variable interest rate currently 792 pct linked to the bank's cost of borrowing World Bank said it approved a 100 mln dlr loan to help Brazil finance the rehabilitation of the railway in Sao Paulo state and establish an institutional reform program as a base for future commercial operation The 285 mln dlr project is designed to financially

priorities is mired in bureaucracy after achieving very few of its aims Officials acknowledge that progress is now minimal Land rights activists see no progress at all and say things are actually worsening Over the last year economic pressures have forced many small producers to sell out to big land-owners Land reform one of the country's most hotly-debated political issues is particularly to the fore this year as a Constituent Assembly in Brasilia draws up a new constitution Land rights campaigners say that if the new charter does not give fresh hope for the country's 45 mln landless families there will be wave upon wave of land occupations We make no secret of our tactics said one leader of the land reform movement Joao Pedro The solution is to occupy -- that is what we say to the rural workers There has not been a single program of land reform in the world without the people occupying land The land issue spawns violence from Amazonia to Mato Grosso Some 278 people died in land disputes last year according to the Pastoral Commission for Land which is linked to the Roman Catholic Church The land reform program announced in 1985 soon after the civilian government of President Jose Sarney took power aimed to resettle 14 mln families by 1989 by gradually splitting up the country's vast undeveloped estates The government in its National Plan for Agrarian Reform described the program as one of its absolute priorities In practice fewer than 20000 families have been helped so far and the government admits that it will not get anywhere near the original target Political analysts said that the pace of land reform was now slower under Sarney than it had been under the military government of General Joao Figueiredo (1979-85) The slow progress on the issue is fuelling deep frustration Land rights demonstrations are a common sight in Sao Paulo and other parts of the country Activists say social conditions in the countryside far from improving have significantly deteriorated Pedro a leader of the Movement of Landless Rural Workers said that over the last 12 months 100000 small producers had been forced off the land in Brazil's five southernmost states He said the exodus had been caused first by the government's anti-inflation Cruzado Plan which last year froze prices and hit the income of small farmers When the Cruzado Plan collapsed late last year prices and interest rates soared and many small farmers were unable to pay debts taken out during the price freeze Pedro said most of the 100000 families who had left the countryside in the south had previously been land-owners while a minority had been tenant farmers Most had moved to Brazil's swollen cities One activist said the number of landless day labourers called boias-frias (literally cold meals) most of whom cut sugar cane had increased to 400000 in Sao Paulo state from about 300000 five years ago In an attempt to improve the lot of the rural poor the land reform movement has drawn up a radical proposal which it is sending to the Constituent Assembly The proposal would severely limit the size of a maximum permissible holding and the land rights movement does not expect it to be voted into the constitution Pedro said at least 70 pct of the 559-member assembly is composed of big land-owners He added that the assembly would probably vote on the proposal by October and that its rejection would be the signal for large-scale land invasions British bulk carrier Envoy which ran aground in the Orinoco river on October 16 was refloated without lightening on October 19 Lloyds Shipping Intelligence service said The Envoy 75453 tonnes dw was carrying a cargo of 50000 tonnes of bauxite from Brazil to Cuba Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to submit details of past export performance in order that individual quotas can be allocated an IBC spokesman said He told IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export performance 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive months between April 1 1985 and September 30 1987 to be used for calculating the export performace portion The IBC will total all the figures calculate each shippers participation and use this as a basis for allocation of individual quotas the IBC spokesman said He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export sales declaration form Auctions will not start until after the opening of export registrations The spokesman could not say when this might be but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of the week opening registraions from Monday A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels the spokesman added A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota indefinite strike by 47000 carworkers on Tuesday closed most Brazilian plants of Autolatina the company said Autolatina one of the world's largest automakers said it had offered its employees a pay rise of 2066 pct adding that the workers were pressing for a 659 pct rise The strike is the first to hit operations of Autolatina since it formally came into existence on July 1 The company groups Ford and Volkswagen in Brazil and Argentina A spokesman said factories in Argentina were unaffected He said about 9000 of the company's 55900 employees in Brazil were still working and some production was continuing September trade surplus was the best so far this year totalling 1494 billion dlrs compared with 1434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in September last year Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference September exports were 2694 billion dlrs slightly down from 276 billion dlrs in August Imports in September amounted to 12 billion dlrs against 132 billion dlrs in August Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period was 7857 billion dlrs compared with 8667 billion dlrs in a similar 1986 period Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports up from 222 mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986 Salek said The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade surplus to average 800 mln dlrs in the remaining three months of the year estimating the year's overall surplus to reach 102 billion dlrs from 256 billion dlrs worth of exports and 154 billion dlrs of imports He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured and semimanufactured goods He mentioned car exports which accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept period against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period will only lift the partial moratorium on its 113-billion-dlr foreign debt after an accord is reached with the private banks the Finance Ministry said in a statement The statement said such agreement currently being negotiated must place the debt within the terms proposed by Brazil on September 25 Brazil proposed to the private creditors a refinancing of the interest on its foreign debt that have expired or will expire up to 1989 totalling an overall 104 billion dlrs Brazil also proposed the end of spreads and conversion into bonds of part of the 70-billion dlrs owed to private banks Brazil in February stopped interest payments on about 68 billion dlrs owed to private banks and the Ministry statement issued on Monday said this would only be lifted when an accord is reached The statement said that a token payment which banks want from the Brazil as a condition to discuss an agreement will only be made when there is a major progress in the negotiations Meanwhile a World Bank mission arrived on Monday to analyse the performance of the Brazilian economy after the new plan launched in July by Finance Minister Luiz Carlos Bresser Pereira

brunei,US Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the US For growth Given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth 
canada,Canada will increase corporate tax revenues by about five billion dlrs over the next five years by broadening the tax base and allowing fewer exemptions finance minister Michael Wilson said As Wilson previously promised he said corporations will bear an increased tax burden despite new measures to lower overall tax rates Increased corporate revenues will result from broadening the tax base and eliminating special tax exemptions The jobs of many Canadians depend on a corporate income tax system that is competitive with other countries particularly the United States Wilson said in a prepared speech to the House of Commons And it (tax reform) will ensure that profitable corporations carry a bigger share of the total tax burden he added Federal tax revenue from corporations will increase by 470 mln dlrs in the fiscal year ending March 31 1988 410 mln dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 119 billion dlrs in fiscal 1990 according to documents tabled with Wilson's speech average tax rate for Canadian financial insitutions will increase to 213 pct from 145 pct under the new tax reform package the federal finance department said The amount of financial institutions' income that is taxed will also increase to 740 pct from 487 pct it said in documents tabled with finance minister Michael Wilson's prepared speech to the House of Commons Under Wilson's plan the federal government will collect 136 billion dlrs more over the next five years from financial insitutions including banks trust mortgage and life insurance companies according to finance department documents Financial institutions are going to complain but we believe the changes are appropriate and affordable said one finance department official who asked not to be identified Ottawa will collect more revenue from financial institutions by reducing the amount of reserves they can deduct from taxes which will broaden the tax base for this low tax paying sector the finance department said Among the changes chartered banks will no longer be able to use a five-year averaging formula to calculate loan losses that may be deducted for tax purposes Effective June 17 1987 banks will deduct bad or doubtful loans during the year they are incurred The finance department said the impact of the new provisions will be cushioned over a period of five years The changes are needed to ensure that all financial companies are taxed fairly under deregulation of the financial services industry It would be inconsistent for the tax system to continue to provide different reserves for tax purposes for institutions competing in the same marketplace the finance department said will broaden a federal sales tax levied on manufacturers before scrapping the system in favor of a broad based multi-staged sales tax finance minister Michael Wilson said As expected Wilson did not include a new sales tax system as part of his wide-ranging tax reforms tabled in the House of Commons today Instead the federal government will make interim changes to the existing sales tax to make it more fair for low and middle income Canadians The present (sales) tax is fundamentally flawed It is a hidden arbitrary and capricious tax Wilson told the House of Commons The existing federal sales tax system hurts the Canadian economy by putting more tax on Canadian produced goods than imported goods and adding a hidden tax on Canadian exports that makes them less competitive Wilson said Interim changes effective January 1 1988 will include: -- applying the federal sales tax to marketing companies related to manufacturers -- levying the tax at the wholesale level instead of the manufacturer for a selected range of products -- applying a 10 pct sales tax to telecommunication services except for residential telephone lines -- quicker collection of federal sales taxes To offset these changes for low income Canadians refundable tax credits will be increased to 70 dlrs from 50 dlrs for adults and to 35 dlrs from 25 dlrs for children the finance department said Ottawa is considering three alternative forms for a new sales tax including a goods and services tax a value added tax and a national sales tax that would combine existing federal and provincial levies into one system Wilson told the House of Commons He said the federal government will explore the possibility of one national sales tax with Canada's 10 provincial governments All provinces except Albeta now levy a provincial sales of tax of varying amounts Wilson said one joint system would be simpler for taxpayers and maximize economic benefits of tax reform If Ottawa and the provinces can't agree on a national sales tax system Wilson said the federal government will consider either a goods and services tax or a value-added tax A goods and services tax would apply at one rate to virtually all goods and services in Canada and would include further increases in refundable tax credits for low and middle income Canadians the finance department said in documents accompanying Wilson's speech A federal value-added tax similar to European tax systems would also be broad based but would allow more flexibility to exempt selected goods and services the department said The finance deparment said the main drawback of a value added tax is that it would be more complex and costly to implement than the other two proposals Minister Michael Wilson said tax reform will not affect his determination to reign in expenditures but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline in the budget deficit in the late 1980s Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 293 billion dlrs in the year ending March 31 1988 the same level as he forecast in the February budget And in the year ended this past March the deficit was expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32 billion dlr shortfall originally forecast Wilson said Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year higher-than-anticipated spending particularly in farm income support programs will be offset by higher-than-anticipated revenues But finance department documents show the pace of deficit reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and 1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the transition to the reformed taxation system The deficit is expected to total 289 billion dlrs in fiscal 1989 and 286 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 261 billion dlrs in 1991 Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian economy forcasting gross domestic product would expand 28 pct this year and 30 pct in 1988 In 1986 the economy grew by an actual 31 pct Inflation meanwhile is expected to stabilize at around the current four pct level over the next two years Minister Michael Wilson tabled a ways and means motion to immediately impose a special tax on preferred share dividends to eliminate a significant loss of corporate tax revenue Under the motion which is used to introduce most financial tax changes dividends on all preferred shares issued after June 18 will be taxable The issuing corporation will be able to choose between two forms of tax one that imposes a 25 pct tax on dividends with a subsequent additional 10 pct tax paid by the shareholder and one that imposes a flat 40 pct tax on dividends Measures to reduce the tax advantages of after-tax financing arrangements using preferred shares are a critical step in achieving the broadened corporate tax base required to fund personal income tax reductions Wilson explained The minister said many profitable corporations using various deductions built up over the years pay no taxes although they are in a position to pay dividends out of their profits Minister Michael Wilson unveiled a wide-ranging reform of the personal tax system that includes limiting the capital gains exemption and a sharp cut in the dividend tax credit With most changes effective at the first of next year Wilson also announced he was cutting the number of tax brackets from 10 to three He said the changes will cut personal tax revenues by two billion dlrs in 1988 and by more than 11 billion dlrs over the next five years Most Canadians will pay lower taxes because of two far-reaching changes A new structure of federal income tax rates and the conversion of exemptions and deductions to tax credits Wilson told the House of Commons The new tax brackets will be 17 pct on the first 27500 dlrs of taxable income 26 pct on the next 27500 dlrs and 29 pct on taxable income in excess of 55000 dlrs The maximum tax rate is 34 pct under the current system In a major reversal of his own initiative Wilson said the controversial 500000 dlrs capital gains exemption will be reduced to 100000 dlrs over an investors' lifetime Wilson introduced the exemption shortly after taking office in 1984 as a a way of stimulating investment but it was sharply criticized by the opposition as over-generous to wealthy investors The 500000 dlr lifetime exemption will be kept on the sale of farm land and for small businesess however Also the taxable portion of a capital gain will increase from 50 pct currently to 66-2/3 pct in 1988 and 75 pct in 1990 The dividend tax credit will be reduced from 33-1/3 pct to 25 pct and the deduction for up to 1000 dlrs of interest and dividend income will be eliminated in 1988 Wilson said tax treatment for registered retirement savings plan contributions will be maintained but the phase in of the increase in the maximum limit to 15500 dlrs will be delayed four years to 1994 sweeping tax reform package announced today is an important step towards a fairer system but is not as bold a revamp of the tax structure as some had expected economists and business leaders said It's the biggest step towards tax reform we've taken in a great many years Merrill Lynch Canada Inc chief economist Michael Manford told But the system is the same old system with a lot of important changes as opposed to a brand new system he added (See spotlight index page on ECRA) Manford said changes introduced by Finance Minister Michael Wilson did not go far enough in simplifying the federal tax system They represent evolutionary rather than revolutionary reform Overall I thought that it was a more timid step than we were led to believe he said Wilson's move to increase money collected from corporations while cutting individual taxes is probably an acceptable shift said Bill James president of Falconbridge Ltd an international mining company Wilson spread corporate tax increases fairly evenly across the corporate sector James said So it's not going to hit anyone too hard and we will remain competitive Wilson said in his speech to the House of Commons that Canada's tax system needed to be changed to compete with sweeping reforms in the United States last year The critical thing on the corporate side is that Wilson moved most of the taxes much closer to the US System Manford said The federal government increased taxes paid by corporations by about five billion dlrs over the next five years but lowered personal taxes by 11 billion dlrs in the same period Despite collecting more corporate taxes Wilson was able to lower the tax rate on individual companies by removing many special tax exemptions and broadening the tax base Wilson's plan also reduced the capital cost allowance used by companies to write off major investments which some business spokesmen said will hurt business in the long run That will affect some investment decisions negatively said Laurent Thiebeault Canadian Manufacturers Association president Tax analysts said for some industries it will take several days to assess the impact of the capital cost allowance reductions that will be made over a number of years As anticipated Canada's opposition parties signalled they intend to fight the new tax measures as they are introduced in Parliament over the next few months It's not tax reform it's a tax grab said Liberal leader John Turner Turner labelled changes to the federal sales tax a money machine for the minister of finance Wilson broadened the federal sales tax to include additional products and also promised to introduce a broad-based multi-staged sales tax It's not at all a fair package and

scuffled with police called in to escort replacement workers across picket lines Letter Carriers Union of Canada President Robert McGarry said the new offer to the union's 20000 members contained only

Tuesday when the Canadian securities industry sets off its own fireworks Some companies are quickly taking advantage of deregulation but more significant moves are likely to be a year or more down the road analysts say They say most foreign firms will focus at first on bond trading debt financing and underwriting areas in which they have experience under the old rules that allowed them to provide government debt financing and advisory services When they learn about Canada they might go into retail said Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada Then they will eventually just start to buy up the little guys If the bigger boys' price comes down they'll end up taking those ones over too Under the new rules barriers that kept banks brokerage houses insurance companies and trust firms out of each others' businesses will be swept away in favor of wide-open competition The deregulation sometimes nicknamed Little Bang will allow Canadian banks and other domestic financial institutions to set up securities units or acquire existing brokerages Foreign companies will also be able to form their own securities divisions in Ontario or buy up to 50 pct of a Canadian firm A year from now they can raise that stake to 100 pct Foreign firms that entered Canada after 1971 can currently own no more than 10 pct of a Canadian brokerage Deregulation was expected to generate a major shakeout by June 30 involving mergers of existing firms and buyouts by foreign and domestic financial giants So far few deals have become reality however despite a swirl of rumors and merger talks In the heat of deregulation fever many Canadian investment dealers are demanding up to four times book value scaring off prospective suitors analysts said I would think they (the brokerages) will have to lower their asking prices said financial services analyst Jeff Carney at Merrill Lynch Canada Inc which recently terminated talks to acquire prominent Canadian brokerage Burns Fry Ltd I think (a high asking price) is what scared Merrill Lynch away from Burns Fry added Carney It is just a lot of money When your asset walks out the door every night it is difficult to pay that amount of cash Carney said another factor in the slow pace of buyouts was uncertainty about the final deregulation rules which were issued and approved only in mid-June Most major foreign and Canadian financial players have focused their deregulation strategy on planning their own Canadian securities units or buying seats on the Toronto Stock Exchange Canada's largest equities market Japan's Nomura Securities Co Ltd Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd Daiwa Securities Co Ltd and Nikko Securities Co Ltd recently bought seats on Toronto's exchange while United States investment banks such as Salomon Inc and Goldman Sachs and Co have set plans for Canadian subsidiaries The few proposed foreign investments in Ontario firms include agreements by New York's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc to raise its stake in McLeod Young Weir Ltd to 30 pct from 10 pct and by the British firm of James Capel and Co to acquire a minority interest in Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd Several industry watchers predict the flood of foreign acquisitions is likely a year away when the newcomers become familiar with Canada Canadian firms will need such international alliances to compete in the increasingly global securities market industry officials said That is one of the hopes of the regulators that the change will throw off one or two Canadian global firms Toronto Stock Exchange president Pearce Bunting told recently Canada's six major banks are also expected to proceed cautiously into the securities field Analysts said the brokers are too expensive now while the banks are coping with Brazilian loan problems Banks will also find it tough to merge their cautious bureaucratic culture with that of leaner more free-wheeling securities dealers they said While the banks have been approached by securities firms seeking merger partners they have not yet bought into brokerages choosing to build securities units from within Last week Royal Bank of Canada the country's biggest bank ended merger talks with Canadian broker Wood Gundy Inc after several months of negotiations But analyst Thompson forecast that if one bank finally acquires an existing firm all the other banks will jump in They don't want to be perceived as

Macaulay said at the annual meeting The committee formed last fall has been trying to determine the voting rights of class A non-voting shares if control of the company changes hands The Ontario Securities Commission blocked a 270 mln dlr takeover bid last January for 49 pct of the company's common shares The OSC said the bid by a group of Canadian Tire store owners abused shareholders rights by circumventing share provisions that would convert non-voting stock into voting shares if more than 50 pct of the stock changed ownership Since then three members of the Billes family who agreed to tender their 60 pct holding of Canadian Tire's common shares to the pro rata offer have commenced legal proceedings amongst themselves Macaulay said he would not comment further on the situation while matters remain in an unsettled state At the meeting president Dean Groussman said the higher profit trend evident in the first quarter ended April 4 was continuing First quarter net rose 10 pct to 211 mln dlrs from 192 mln dlrs a year earlier Groussman also said the company plans sharply higher capital spending this year of 103 mln dlrs compared to 43 mln dlrs last year and it will likely maintain

to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with

not erect artificial barriers Under the Canadian proposal all countries would have to ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade a government background paper said Furthermore in assessing the trade impact of programs credit could be given to countries which effectively control the output of farm products the papers said Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the US free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking Yeutter made his remarks at a US-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord The Canadian-US pact signed by two sides two weeks ago has yet been approved by the US Congress and Canadian Parliament The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market they had better get serious about improving the GATT The pact with Israel he said is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT Yeutter said increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe He said a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity not only for advanced industrial nations but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade The legislation was prompted by a growing US trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto He said President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws and I believe that veto would be sustained 46 cts vs 50 cts Net 109 mln vs 120 mln Revs 1052 mln vs 1000 mln Note: Canadian Marconi Co

Ontario Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added

colombia,European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added US government trade official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers Jon Rosenbaum an assistant US trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas There is one country which evidently still does not Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas head of the Colombian coffee producers federation who was in Europe Cardenas left a positive letter Rosenbaum said The Cardenas letter responded to a US letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement The US has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless objective criteria which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits countries should not intervene in the distribution of coffee export quotas Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster said Distribution of export quotas should be in the hands of producers as has been traditional Dauster a delegate at the recent coffee symposium here told journalists When consumers want to get involved talks are much more difficult The main consumer country the United States and main producer Brazil failed to reach agreement on quota distribution when the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) met in February Dauster said Brazil's role when the ICO meets in London in September will be to support the world coffee pact defend its market share and argue for distribution of quotas to be in the hands of producer countries We have sacrificed a great deal already he said this year we have a crop of 35 mln bags we have economic problems and we are not in a position to do favours has opened export registrations for November coffee shipments trade sources said No further details were available

cyprus,US Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying The rigs one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf the minister told a news conference in Tehran He said the Reshadat rigs 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in international waters were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the US Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying The

about 500 mln dlrs The rigs one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack he said Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed Aqazadeh said: Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and US Interests around the world might come under attack Aqazadeh said the US Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult but he did not see the US Attack significantly affecting oil prices IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait no other country can either and this would be to everyone's harm the radio quoted him as saying top war spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the US Attacks on two of its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation God willing we will carry out our duty in the coming days and make them sorry said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament later broadcast by Tehran Radio The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance after the US Raids on the rigs one of which was destroyed President Ali Khamenei Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the US Action have all vowed retaliation Rafsanjani the parliamentary speaker said It is not a threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it in practice He added that the American attack squares neither with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with security nor reason and wisdom US Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and American special forces boarded another destroying equipment The US Government said the attack was a measured response to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday said several people were injured in Monday's US Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed retaliation Tehran radio reported It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying We will definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move unanswered A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east

(formerly Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's missile attack on a US-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters The US Said Iranians used the platforms for military pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs earlier this month Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or personnel and said the US Attack lacked miltary value With this move Mr Reagan has committed a big mistake and has definitely increased his problems top Iranian military official said America's attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday had involved the United States in full-scale war and Iran would avenge it with a crushing blow The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the head of Iran's war information headquarters as saying The official Kamal Kharrazi said Washington had now become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with Iran It was the first official Iranian reaction to the

el-salvador,European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has reallocated 13 mln dlrs in credit guarantees originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El Salvador so it may buy rice the US Agriculture Department said The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales of protein meals to 127 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit guarantee line of 13 mln dlrs the department said All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be registered and exports completed by September 30 the department said Salvador will tender October 26 for approximately 26000 tonnes soybean meal valued at up to 56 mln dlrs and about 24500 tonnes bulk corn with a value of 20 mln dlrs under PL-480 financing an agent for the country said It said the country is seeking soymeal with 48 pct protein minimum 12 pct moisture maximum and 35 pct maximum crude fiber for delivery from November 15-30 The US no 2 or better yellow corn with 145 pct moisture maximum is for delivery from November 8-25 Offers on the soymeal and corn are due at 1530 hrs EDT (1930 gmt) Oct 26 and will remain valid until 1000 hrs EDT the next day the agent said

france,Australia's economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 25 pct this year and by 275 pct in 1988 compared with only 14 pct in 1986 The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages it added The report forecasts a decline in inflation with consumer prices increasing by 85 pct this year and 625 pct in 1988 The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988 While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year however the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 375 pct The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis The country's GDP which contracted by 06 pct last year should again show growth over the next two years rising by 025 pct this year and a more substantial 275 pct in 1988 electronics group La Telemecanique Electric <TLMFPA> expects 1987 consolidated profits to remain steady on 1986 levels allowing the company to pay a higher dividend

domestic appliance maker Moulinex <MOUPPA> shares continued to fall on the Paris Bourse reaching its year's low amid controversy over an auditor's report on 1987 profit forecasts dealers said A Moulinex spokesman said a mutilated copy of the report by Paris auditors Syndex which gave a poor impression of the company's prospects had caused the stock to fall sharply Meanwhile Moulinex said in a communique that it stood by its April forecast of a 1987 parent company net loss of 417 mln francs vs a 226 mln loss in 1986 The spokesman said 50 pages of the 200-page report commissioned by Moulinex's staff/management committee had been circulated to several Parisian stockbrokers The Syndex report said the company's 1987 target would be difficult to achieve thereby causing Moulinex stock to drop almost 13 francs in two days to 7510 francs per share A Syndex spokesman said yesterday that the auditors were shocked by the leak of a confidential document and attributed it to malicious intentions Several Paris brokers said it was likely that corporate raiders interested in a takeover bid had put out the Syndex report to bring down the share price Moulinex shares have fluctuated considerably since the beginning of the year on takeover rumours reaching a high of 122 francs Group president Jean Mantelet who is 87 said in February that he intended to transfer his 42 pct stake in

rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it

this year Paris Club of creditor nations agreed to a major rescheduling of Uganda's and Mozambique's government-to-government debts the Club said in a statement At meetings here this week both countries were accorded terms that were more generous than usually granted by the Club Uganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-year grace period while Mozambique was accorded an exceptionally long 20-year period with 10 years' grace The Club said it approved of both countries' economic and financial programs and would therefore make a contribution to improve their external payments prospects It said both countries faced heavy debt service obligations and low per capita income adding the solution of the countries' debt problems would take a number of years The statement also said Mozambique's limited debt service capacity made borrowing from the International Monetary Fund in the upper credit tranches inappropriate No details were available from the countries' embassies nor from the Club on the amounts involved but last week the Ugandan Finance Minister Chrispus Kiyonga said he was hoping for a rescheduling of 120 mln dlrs Uganda's total foreign debt is

will make a profit I envisage per share profits of 25 francs he said I am very optimistic Bouygues said exceptional costs associated with the restructuring of the station would prevent a profit this

the hour-long meeting Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex green currrency system designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against along with Britain Denmark and the Netherlands EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks

Britain West Germany France and Italy) he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer interest rates have been dropping Wilson said The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries Wilson said This has been going on during the course of yesterday through the evening and this morning and this will continue he said What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economieslooks good Wilson said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur has been in contact with several Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in particular West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg to discuss the crisis on world markets Finance Ministry sources said They did not say whether the contacts had led to concerted action on the markets or merely an exchange of views But they added that French ministry officials were continuing the contacts to exchange views on market performance European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said French government plans to cancel part of Renault's debt as part of a strategy of returning the state car group to financial independence but will not provide it with more subsidies industry ministry sources said The plan which has been under study for several weeks is linked to legislation enabling Regie Nationale des Usines Renault <RENAPA> to be converted into a limited company they said This legislation should be ready for parliament in the next few days the sources said Renault's debt would be cut to some 40 billion francs from the December 1986 level of 56 billion francs they said European Airbus consortium is ready to cooperate with US Aerospace group McDonnell Douglas Corp on future aircraft programs pointing the way to a defusion of the transatlantic dispute on subsidies to the aircraft industry French Transport Ministry Jacques Douffiagues said He told the southern French daily Depeche du Midi in an interview today that the talks between senior US And European Community officials in London on October 27 on the Airbus question should be more harmonious as a result Airbus officials said last week that they were continuing talks on possible collaboration with McDonnell Doughlas on aircraft projects including an eventual stretched version of the Airbus A320 short-haul jet but that collaboration in the immediate future was unlikely US Manufacturers and officials have charged that the French British and West German governments have disrupted the world aviation market by unfairly subsidising Airbus allowing it to undercut private US Competitors while the Europeans have responded by saying that US Manufacturers benefit from large government-funded military contracts Douffiagus said that transatlantic cooperation was already widespread in aircraft construction voiced its comprehension for a US Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to the Gulf War to avoid further escalation The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all states to take action under international law and the United Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16 the Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a US-flagged Kuwaiti ship Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping The French statement described the target as an Iranian military platform But the French statement added that everything must be done now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new escalation of the conflict European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year an EC commission spokesman said He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on US Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones the spokesman said Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming US Manufacturers It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France Britain West Germany and Spain the countries involved in the Airbus project Disc Products Co Inc a unit fo Genevar Enterprises Inc said it has purchased the ongoing business trademarks and certain assets of Rhone-Poulenc's Brown Disc Manufacturing unit for undisclosed terms Rhone-Poulenc is a French-based chemical company Under the agreement Rhone-Poulenc will supply magnetic tape and media products to Brown Disc Products finance minister Edouard Balladur said the agenda of state privatisations may not be done at full speed if market conditions prove unsuitable I'm not going to privatise at full speed if market conditions do not permit That would be absurd he told journalists What we're going to do is adapt our program very closely to the evolution of our stock markets French stock prices fell more than 10 pct on Monday a 6-1/2 year record as concern deepened that interest rates worldwide would surge and choke off fragile economic growth dealers said Stock of several privatised firms fell below their issue price Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries should respect pledges on monetary policy made in the February Louvre accord on currency stability We have to strengthen the cooperation between the seven major industrial countries and remind ourselves of the pledges we made at the Louvre he told journalists They were not simply pledges to maintain currency stability but also to conduct a certain type of economic and monetary policy he added Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries should respect pledges on monetary policy made in the February Louvre accord on currency stability We have to strengthen the cooperation between the seven major industrial countries and remind ourselves of the pledges we made at the Louvre he told journalists They were not simply pledges to maintain currency stability but also to conduct a certain type of economic and monetary policy he added Balladur's comments came after US Treasury Secretary James Baker said on Sunday that the US Would have to re-examine the Louvre accords in the light of the rise in West German short-term interest rates Balladur was one of the main architects of the Louvre accord and has invested considerable political capital in defending them Louvre accord on currency stability which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil foreign exchange dealers said But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive US Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan who both have large trade surpluses pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the US While the US Agreed to stop talking the dollar down However Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative the West German interest rate move would force the US To re-examine the accord The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany  He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation Chris Johns currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view telling that the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur who hosted the Louvre meeting was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks He called for a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord In Frankfurt F Wilhelm Christians joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank said that following recent meetings with Baker he believed that the US Was still committed to the accord In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 380 pct on Monday down from the 385 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major industrial countries Balladur responding to weekend remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the US Would take another look at the accords said I firmly desire a faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit On Sunday Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords The Louvre accords agreed in Paris last February called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them he added Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major industrial countries Balladur responding to weekend remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the US Would take another look at the accords said I firmly desire a faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit On Sunday Baker said last week's rise in

Reserve Bank of India RBI announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad The move is designed by the government to improve India's trade deficit Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags cigarettes coffee leather various textiles chemicals pharmaceuticals plastics engineering and electronic goods ready-made garments processed food sports goods fabricated mica and consultancy services The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product RBI said under the new rule 16 other products will qualify on a discretionary basis for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings These include oil cakes cereals raw cotton raw and semi-processed leather gems castor and sandalwood oil psyllium husks and seeds opium and various mineral ores RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings Industry sources said the new entitlements considerably higher than the previous limits are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes United States and India have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Lyng told in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance Lyng said At this point there is no detailed plan or program The amounts of what commodities are uncertain But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable he said There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419 of an amended 1949 law Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot of taking care of themselves India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that Lyng said We (the United States) obviously with the surpluses we still have of many commodities would like to share in the import business the Indians do and then we have some as we always do compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them he said Lyng said he had no plans to meet with Indian officials during Gandhi's visit here adding I just don't know of anything that might be announced specifically Asked if the ball was in the Indians' court he said Yes Gandhi is to leave Washington Tuesday evening Reserve Bank of India said it was tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising their cash reserve ratio by 05 pct to 10 pct effective from October 24 The move announced last weekend is part of the bank's policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity The central bank also put selective controls on bank advances to the oilseeds vegetable oils and foodgrains trades The policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit requirements of agriculture industry and exports while preventing excessive monetary expansion bank Governor RN Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept under control in the second half of the current financial year Bank deposits rose 7540 billion rupees in the first six months of fiscal 1987/88 against 6692 billion in the same period last year according to the bank Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve ratio by 05 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees from the banking system Banks' total deposits are estimated at around 1000 billion rupees They said banks are under pressure because of low returns on commercial lending and investments in government securities Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings said one banker Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a

indonesia,US Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the US For growth Given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth has increased its share in a 434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from 25 to 37 pct Asahan Project Authority director AR Suhud said The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised its share of (PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion by swapping 32 billion yen in government loans to the company for an equity stake The Japanese shareholders the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and 12 companies are to invest another 24 billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen Asahan reported total losses of 976 billion rupiah between 1982 and 1985 Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation of the yen against the US Dollar Aluminium is sold in dollars Prices improved from 1150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to about 1450 dlrs today The plant is supposed to break even if prices stay at 1500 dlrs a tonne Sahud said the plant with a capacity of 220000 tonnes a year would probably lose money again in 1987 The plant situated in North Sumatra produces mostly for Japan cabinet approved a plan to help financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and Brazil an official at the Ministry of International and Trade Industry (MITI) said Japan will invest 24 billion yen in <PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium> in addition to the 683 billion yen already invested in the company The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment he said They will also provide equal shares in 63 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil in addition to the 457 billion yen already invested The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct the official said Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct but an agreement has yet to be reached industry sources said Under the rescue scheme for Asahan in which 911 billion yen has been invested Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 65 billion yen in Albras in which investment now totals 932 billion yen but its stake will not change from 51 pct the official said The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected reflecting Japan's desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand which totals some 18 mln tonnes a year they said will lend 2717 billion yen to Indonesia and will share equally with the World Bank a 725 billion yen loan to Bolivia as part of its efforts to help Third World countries a Foreign Ministry spokesman said The lending is in line with Japan's plan to contribute 20 billion dlrs over the next three years to developing countries Both loans will be used for development the spokesman told He declined to name terms coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates prices would skyrocket for a time if conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said He made no explicit reference to the latest US Military action in the Gulf But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association he said If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off I believe the world oil supply given time to adjust can take care of the situation But this is not to say that prices at least for a short duration will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation he declared Tensions in the Gulf however usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices he added Assessing future price trends he said Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel The upward deviations however are likely to be greater than the downward ones The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate he added Non-Opec production may still go up competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand Subroto a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members said speculation may play havoc with spot prices but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers In the medium term non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s leaving Opec much stronger he said Minister for Trade Negotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on reducing the large subsidies which the European Community and United States grant their farmers Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform the EC Common Agricultural Policy and US Plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction I am hopefully optimistic There is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the USA the EC and the Cairns Group he told reporters Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks on farm subsidies The group which includes Australia and Malaysia advocates free farm trade and says US European and Japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in North and South America the EC and Thailand and leaves for Indonesia on Wednesday Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East Aceh on the western tip of northern Sumatra a company spokesman said The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1 offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2300 metres within the Baong formation he said He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow oil at the rate of 1320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at 20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln standard cubic feet a day he added GOS IA-1 well located at a water depth of 41 metres was drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina and Japex North Sumatra Ltd each having 50 pct shares Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as operator through a joint operating body established by the two companies the Pertamina spokesman stated The contract covers the Gebang block contract area The two companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1 exploratory well around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1 told the oil industry on Tuesday it will extend contracts on producing blocks and improve the investment climate but wants to see increased expenditure on exploration in return President Suharto in an opening speech to the Indonesian Petroleum Association said Indonesia was ready to extend contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry the government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending production sharing contracts under the present laws Suharto said Apart from that the government will keep improving the investment climate in order to accelerate the development of the petroleum industry he said Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be renewed before they would invest in further exploration As we all have heard this morning the President is fully aware of this situation Subroto said The government has already made the political decision to entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers to continue their activities in Indonesia albeit on a selective basis Indonesia one of the 13 members of OPEC must find new oil reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade oil industry sources say Subroto said the government was also working to ease other problems including granting easier terms for remote areas or deep water conditions But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now that the oil price had recovered President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of technology to Indonesian companies and more help from the oil industry for the regions in which companies operated Abdul Rachman Ramly the President of state oil company Pertamina has said that budgeted exploration and production expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to fall to 31 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 34 billion in 1986 Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation contracts with foreign oil companies Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field operations was a government priority There had been misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry in certain areas such as when a field is designated commercial and a thorough evaluation was being made He said the government wanted to finalise contract extensions as soon as practical and urged the industry in the meantime to maintain its exploration drive Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain exploration efforts even if their contract was due to expire within 10 years This need in itself is some sort of guarantee that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal between 1991 and 2001 industry sources said Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions would be selective based on how much capital would be invested proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the US Senate The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote virtually snuffing out US soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year A similar proposal has made no headway in the House Sen Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package I don't see this as a trade issue I see it as giving American consumers the information they need he said Proponents of the measure including the American Soybean Association have claimed palm palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease The US soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils imported primarily from Malaysia Indonesia and the Philippines But Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind) read a letter from US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter who said the proposal blatantly discriminates against imports would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils The committee voted largely along party lines with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure Motors Inc said it has agreed to become become the exclusive North American importer of the Lincan Gama a four-wheel-drive sport vehicle manufactured by <PT Indauda> of Indonesia In a letter of intent it signed with PT Indauda Global said it expects to begin marketing the first Lincan Gamas in mid-1989 with 20000 units projected to be marketed in the first year Global is the parent company of Yugo America Inc importer of the Yugoslavian Yugo vehicle 
iran,US crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said crude oil prices are

inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said output for the second half of 1987 including that of Iraq will be above the official 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said Iraq refused to sign the pact by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 166 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987 In December OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 183 mln bpd now cut back to the third quarter target Ali told a news conference that including Iraq OPEC third quarter output will be between 175 and 177 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices Iraq has an official first half quota of 1466 mln bpd rising to 154 mln in the second half but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran which has a quota of 2255 mln bpd rising to 2369 mln in the second half Ali said the position of the 400000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude was fixed We will not discuss it There will not be any change he said Ali said the conference which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting We sweep a lot under the carpet he said Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting Ali said The problem of differentials is a real one I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9 Ali said If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue I will not do the work of another minister Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1 with a spread of 265 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes has rejected its new OPEC production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this year the official Iraqi news agency INA reported It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi who returned Sunday as saying Iraq will continue to adhere to its position considering itself as not included in the agreement Last December Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987 quota of 1466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2255 mln bpd quota set for Iran its enemy in the nearly seven-year-old Gulf war The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set an output ceiling of 166 mln bpd for the group's 13 members from July to December raising Iraq's share to 154 mln bpd and Iran's to 2369 mln moves to increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran diplomats said They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington As Iran knows very well what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage said one western diplomat Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on soft targets such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf The risk of Iranian attack on US Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the US Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low However There is the threat that the Iranians seeing these heavily protected US-flag tankers will go for softer targets one diplomat said Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us The US is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz The build-up ties in with US plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which the US says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz The Missouri with its four-escort flotilla is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles diplomats said A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula within range of Kuwait But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation likely moving world opinion against Iran remarked one Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf Rafsanjani who is also parliamentary leader predicted last Friday a river of blood throughout the world in the event of any US strike against Iran Western diplomats said Iran which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the US itself Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran they added House Speaker Jim Wright said he would question President Reagan tomorrow about his plan to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers with US warships from attacks by Iran in the Gulf House and Senate Democrats who control Congress have been critical of Reagan's plan but have not decided how or if they should try to pass legislation to prohibit it Wright a Texas Democrat told reporters the Administration had gone ahead with plans to reflag the Kuwaiti tankers as US ships without asking Congressional leaders for their advice and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have agreed to initiate efforts to end the Iraq- Iran war UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rashid Abdulla al-Nuaimi said today on return from Belgrade We agreed during the talks to initiate efforts to end the Iraq-Iran war call for an international peace conference for the Middle East and to revive and support the Non-Aligned states the Emirates news agency WAM quoted him as saying He was the first senior UAE official to visit Yugoslavia since the two countries established diplomatic relations last November United States responded to an apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would play purely a deterrent role I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent that we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and that that shipping is not related to the war itself State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of an armed encounter with us We are not concerned about this and believe that the US Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious We are determined to stand firm and will certainly win The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the strategic Strait of Hormuz entrance to the Gulf The buildup ties in with US Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks Asked about the Iranian rhetoric White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said We won't have any comment or response to the Iranian statements Our position has been made clear about the status of events in the Gulf We want an end to the war with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not helpful or welcome Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping said it understood why the US Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday Japan deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the ships navigating in the Gulf understands the circumstances that have led the United States government to take these measures the Foreign Ministry said in a statement The statement added that the threat to free and safe navigation had increased after the missile attack on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday oil prices would remain stable despite the US Attack against Iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the Gulf Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday He described the situation as extremely tense but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 185 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd he told a news conference Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were overproducing in an exaggerated manner above their assigned quotas he said OPEC's overall ceiling is 166 mln bpd Iranian shuttle tanker reported spotting a floating mine in the central Gulf on Tuesday about 50 miles west of Lavan Island regional shipping sources said The Khark III owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co gave the position of the mine as 27 degrees 14 minutes north 5206 east There was no indication of measures being taken against the mine which is in Iranian territorial waters Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying The rigs one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf the minister told a news conference in Tehran He said the Reshadat rigs 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in international waters were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi reiterated his country would retaliate for US Navy attacks on Gulf oil platforms The US Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our national sovereignty  And we will retaliate properly for this perfidious American aggression Mousavi told a news conference in Damascus On Monday US Navy warships blasted the Rostam platform and Navy personnel stormed a second platform a few miles away Washington said the operation was aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault neutral Gulf shipping is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the US Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran He earlier estimated the damage from the US Raid at about 500 mln dlrs The rigs one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack he said Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed Aqazadeh said: Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and US Interests around the world might come under attack Aqazadeh said the US Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult but he did not see the US Attack significantly affecting oil prices IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait no other country can either and this would be to everyone's harm the radio quoted him as saying Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi reiterated his country would retaliate for US Navy attacks on Gulf oil platforms The US Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our national sovereignty  And we will retaliate properly for this perfidious American aggression Mousavi told a news conference in Damascus On Monday US Navy warships blasted the Rostam platform and Navy personnel stormed a second platform a few miles away Washington said the operation was aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault neutral Gulf shipping top war spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the US Attacks on two of its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation God willing we will carry out our duty in the coming days and make them sorry said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament later broadcast by Tehran Radio The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance after the US Raids on the rigs one of which was destroyed President Ali Khamenei Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the US Action have all vowed retaliation Rafsanjani the parliamentary speaker said It is not a threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it in practice He added that the American attack squares neither with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with security nor reason and wisdom US Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and American special forces boarded another destroying equipment The US Government said the attack was a measured response to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday and the Soviet Union have provisionally agreed to hold talks on a possible exchange of Iranian crude oil for finished Soviet oil products an official spokesman said Tuesday Gennady Gerasimov chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Information Directorate told reporters the agreement had been reached during a visit to Moscow last week by Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh Gerasimov said no date had been set for the talks which would also study the possibility of Soviet technical assistance for Iran's oil industry United States warned Iran again that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military action in the Gulf as US warships began escorting another tanker convoy southward from Kuwait US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the US sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig Several hours later the Pentagon announced that US warships had begun escorting two US flag Kuwaiti tankers -- the 80000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46000 ton liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of US flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT under the escort by the US guided missile frigate Ford It did not say what oth US warships were in the area It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the central Gulf the Pentagon statement said Asked on NBC's Today program if the United States was prepared for a major war with Iran Weinberger said Well we are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from this situation but we don't look on it as a war Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is proposing a simultaneous ceasefire and inquiry into who started the Iran-Iraq war under a revised peace plan an Arab newspaper reported on Tuesday The United Arab Emirates daily al-Khaleej published what it said was the text of his nine-point peace plan The Al-Khaleej text referred to a ceasefire date as D-day and stipulated On D-day or another date to be agreed upon an impartial body to enquire into responsibility for the conflict would start work A choice could be made among existing bodies or an ad hoc body could be established the text said The text also envisaged setting a deadline for the body to complete its work by new hostilities involving US forces in the Gulf the US Senate voted to end Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy The measure however does not require President Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate bill The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of US forces from the Gulf The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue including an expression of support or of disapproval for Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in the waterway The Pentagon said the 12th US-protected convoy began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday military planners ruled out Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war defense and Middle East experts said US naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a measured and appropriate response to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action Norman Polmar a defense analyst and author said He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack In addition it minimized the risk to US forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack Anthony Cordesman author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire We want the UN peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all he said adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf We have chosen a military target but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities Cordesman said He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his country's close and closed-mouthed cooperation with Washington in the Gulf a senior US official said The Saudis are being very cooperative It would be nice if the Saudis would go more public but it's their real estate said the official who asked not to be named He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were providing saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has stationed forces to protect shipping lanes The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after US naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the US flag Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack the prince who is here on an official visit replied I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower The senior US official said his remark was an endorsement of the US attack General Javier Perez de Cuellar has proposed an impartial inquiry into the causes of the Gulf war while Iran and Iraq observe a ceasefire diplomatic sources said on Tuesday His nine-point plan a refinement of proposals he took to Tehran and Baghdad last month was delivered to the two sides last week with a request that they let him have their initial views before October 30 The proposals appeared to counter Iran's earlier offer of an undeclared cessation of hostilities if an inquiry into responsibility for the war was begun Iraq insisted on a formal unconditional ceasefire Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council on his return to New York on September 16 As in his original proposals the revised plan termed D-day a specific date to be agreed upon for the observance of a ceasefire diplomats said On a specific date after that which would have to be agreed the withdrawal of all forces to internationally recognized boundaries would begin and be completed within an agreed time frame according to the account of his proposals State Department says many US diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible retaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oil platforms by American forces in the Gulf At the same time the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that US forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoy southward through the Gulf from Kuwait The State Department renewed its warning to Americans not to travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called its virulent anti-American policies and support for terrorism The threat to Americans has increased significantly she said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice it last made in January The department said about 2600 American citizens live in Iran the overwhelming majority dual nationalities Oakley said no specific warning has been issued to US diplomats and Americans living abroad in the aftermath of the US attack on the oil drilling platforms but many of our missions are on a high state of alert new convoy of tankers escorted by American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday towards Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being blasted by US Navy raiders Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles however and frontline emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat I think the predominant feeling  Is of being scared this conflict will escalate a top West German Foreign Ministry official Helmut Schaefer told reporters in Bahrain after a tour of three Gulf states b Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's US Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the Gulf Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf would stay out for the time being following Monday's US Action But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the area Iran having vowed to react strongly after Monday's US Action launched a barrage of threats and ridicule For its part Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that it was ready for any further hostile action Pentagon officials then announced that a US Guided missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying the US flag southwards--the 80000 tonne product carrier Ocean City and 46000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King shells from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq fell on Kuwait's northern border on Tuesday but caused no casualties the Kuwait News Agency KUNA said quoting a Defense Ministry official There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in retaliation for US Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf on Monday Several shells fell in a random manner on the northern border of the country the official told KUNA It seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq No one was wounded and there were no losses Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier told he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil installations US Senate on Tuesday backed President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday's US attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag The measure said the attack was a firm indication of US resolve that Iran cannot take military action against the United States with impunity Earlier the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy The measure however does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act which could lead to a pullout of US forces from the Gulf While Democrats and Republicans praised the US retaliatory strike many voiced new fears about the growing US involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act United States invoked the right of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf the American delegation told the United Nations Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci the delegate of Italy and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar UN press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary General had no comment on the attack which followed his appeal last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq In his explanation Walters said the United States took defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against American ships in the Gulf He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle City Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations (Charter) I wish on behalf of my government to report that United States forces have exercised the inherent right of self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action in response to attacks by    Iran against United States vessels in the Gulf Walters said Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war but no statement was issued afterwards voiced its comprehension for a US Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to the Gulf War to avoid further escalation The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all states to take action under international law and the United Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16 the Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a US-flagged Kuwaiti ship Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping The French statement described the target as an Iranian military platform But the French statement added that everything must be done now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new escalation of the conflict lawmakers rallied behind President Reagan for the US strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress debate over limits on his powers to make war The Pentagon announced on Monday that US warships destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf ship traffic and military operations and also raided a second Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag Many Democrats who control Congress and Republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate measured response But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States could erupt into a major war and demanded that Reagan comply with the 1973 War Powers Act which could lead to a pullout of American forces from the waterway Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war with Iran said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon a Republican Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz met for an hour with Vice President George Bush on Monday after US naval forces destroyed one Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and raided another Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack the Crown Prince who is here on an official visit replied I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower His remark appeared to be an implicit endorsement of the US action which the Pentagon said came in retaliation for last Friday's Iranian missile attack on a US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Administration officials said Bush had assured the Crown Prince the United States would stay the course in the Gulf They said Prince Abdullah who is deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia and commander of the kingdom's national guard was very supportive of the US role in the strategic waterway Before meeting with Bush the Crown Prince paid a brief courtesy call on President Reagan During his stay in Washington he was also scheduled to meet with Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leaders of the House and Senate foreign policy committees Prime Minister Giovanni Goria told the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased tension in the Gulf but said America's retaliation against Iran had been limited A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had been informed by the United States that it would take action against an Iranian target in the Gulf but had not known beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil platform The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible consequences of increased tension in the Gulf at the same time recognizing the limited character of the American military reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days the statement said Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution Italy has sent eight ships including three frigates and three minesweepers to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant shipping there foreign minister ali akbar velayati here on a two-day official visit informed cuban foreign ministry officials on monday on the tense situation in the gulf diplomatic sources said They said the envoy's trip to be followed from tuesday by a visit to nicaragua could be linked to a possible mediation of the non-aligned movement in the seven-year-old iran-iraq war but they ruled out any prominent cuban role in it Velayati could not be reached for comment on the US Attack on an abandoned iranian oil rig on monday which tehran vowed to avenge Crowe chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff predicted Iran will retaliate for the US strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian options were limited They will be determined They will not be easily deterred and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not going to be risk free or casualty free He said the most likely Iranian response would involve terrorism or the laying of mines They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the president We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was professionally and well done Crowe said warships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile attack on a US flag tanker the Pentagon said President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile waterway Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by four US destroyers which fired about 1000 five-inch shells at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf A short time later Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar and communications equipment before leaving the structure the Pentagon said Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig The United States said both platforms were being used to keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf crisis The United States is fully entitled to take military action in exercise of rights of self-defense in the face of the imminent threat of further attacks Howe said in a statement issued in London The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a US- flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday Referring to that attack Howe added I trust the Iranians will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of European Community (EC) ministers Howe was asked about statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was now involved in a full-scale war It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified for Iran to react in that way he said oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night One of them sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield was all but blown out of the water by US Warships on Monday The Iranian platform an unsightly mass of steel and concrete was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four US Destroyers pumped some 1000 shells into it The US Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained US helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and US forces attacked seized and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines But Iran was not deterred according to US defense officials who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a US-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran Henry Schuler a former US diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of US intervention and Iran's response The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a US tit-for-tat policy that gave Iran the initiative said Harlan Ullman an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS He said with this appraoch America would suffer the death of one thousand cuts But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass Schuler said He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table If vital supplies were cut off Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980 Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties Each side has attacked the others' shipping US attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies Western diplomats in the region said US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that US Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday We consider the matter closed he said a signal the US administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis saying military action would endanger American interests Following the raid a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a crushing blow The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely Tehran Radio quoted him as saying Diplomats noted however Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering they said The ball is in Iran's court now It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other a diplomat said President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation one diplomat said This was better for US Relations with the Gulf Arab states particularly Kuwait Commented another diplomat: Kuwait must be happy that the US Has done something but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep One source said of the attack on the oil platform: They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody A diplomat commented: They were very clever in the place they chose It gets attention but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: This was a good measured response without risking a flare-up  It is a face-saving response (for the Americans) experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following US destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a US-flagged tanker The experts told Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors blockading its shipping or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues said Fred Axelgard a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) It's like a Greek tragedy said retired Adm Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area where the Navy began escorting US-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran which President Reagan could never accept US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd Young Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said We consider this matter closed he said Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the US reaction was measured reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed It had not taken this view after earlier clashes Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said he foresaw market stability in the price of crude despite growing tension in the Gulf augmented by the US military attack on an Iranian oil platform He told a news conference the market continues to be stable despite all the military action in the Gulf supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the US Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday analysts said December loading rose to 1965 dlrs up 45 cents before falling to around 1905/15 later unchanged from last Friday Fundamentals are awful said Philip Lambert analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 185 mln bpd little changed from September levels Peter Nicol analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank said OPEC production could be about 185-190 mln in October and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 185 mln bpd The US Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the US Flag the Sea Isle City It was struck by a missile believed to be Iranian in Kuwaiti waters and was the first hit on a US Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war The US Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday also believed struck by an Iranian missile Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the US Attack analysts said They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz through which around eight mln bpd passes isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the US Or Iran they said Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities analysts said But they saw the US Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks with some describing it as responsible Geoffrey Pyne analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew said he was impressed by the sensible US Response The US Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response Today's action by the US Was not escalatory Pyne said Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the US Strike was a responsible retaliation with the US Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view however He said he was unable to see what the US Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia whose interests the US Is supposedly defending will feel less secure as a result of the US Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a US Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula close to Kuwait analysts said The later downtrend followed confirmation of a US Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact and finding it less serious than first thought took profits taking prices lower analysts and traders said said several people were injured in Monday's US Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed retaliation Tehran radio reported It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying We will definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move unanswered A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of Qatar were injured when US Warships bombarded them this afternoon It described damage as severe Washington said four American frigates shelled and destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's missile attack on a US-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters The US Said Iranians used the platforms for military pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs earlier this month Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or personnel and said the US Attack lacked miltary value With this move Mr Reagan has committed a big mistake and has definitely increased his problems European Community (EC) will not issue a joint statement on the US Attack on Iran for now diplomats said They said the latest events in the Gulf were discussed only briefly by foreign ministers over lunch though member states had been informed by Washington that it was planning military action They didn't have enough information to discuss it fully and they wouldn't have agreed anyway one diplomat said Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans said Belgium had always opposed an extension of violence in the Gulf and deeply regretted that the situation had deteriorated But British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the United States was fully entitled to take military action and Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain said the US Strike could be considered an af self-defence UN Security Council was called to a private meeting on Monday for consultations following the United States attack on an Iranian oil platform Meanwhile a UN spokesman said that as far as he knew a report to the council and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar on the action had not been received from the Americans In Washington President Reagan said the United Nations was being informed of the attack under the provision of the UN Charter regarding notification of actions taken under the right of self-defense The UN spokesman Francois Giuliani said Perez de Cuellar had no comment on the attack taken in response to Iranian action against an American-owned tanker last week but was trying to find out what actually happened Calls to Iran's UN commission elicited no response top Iranian military official said America's attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday had involved the United States in full-scale war and Iran would avenge it with a crushing blow The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the head of Iran's war information headquarters as saying The official Kamal Kharrazi said Washington had now become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with Iran It was the first official Iranian reaction to the attack by four US Navy destroyers on the Reshadat oil platform official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a US Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels The confrontation is a fact now What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration Krutikhin said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf saying their presence serves to increase tension Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year Krutikhin said: The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials said US Naval forces attacked two of its oil platforms in the southern Gulf on Monday afternoon the Iranian news agency IRNA reported IRNA received in Nicosia said an informed source at the Iranian oil ministry identified the two platforms as Resalat and Reshadat about 60 miles from Iran's Lavan island oil storage site Regional shipping sources earlier said three Iranian offshore oil sites at Sassan Rostam and Rakhsh had been attacked at 700 AM (0300 GMT) on Monday by unidentified aircraft In Washington US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said four US Destroyers attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain warships attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's Iranian attack damaging a US-flagged ship US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said When asked how much was left of the oil platform Weinberger said Nothing There was no Iranian reaction he said  We consider this matter is now closed Weinberger said four US destroyers attacked the platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire at 0700 EDT Weinberger said We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with and be a source of potential attack on convoys Weinberger said at a Pentagon briefing We know it has been used indeed to not only launch small boat attacks on shipping but to fire on US helicopters It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of US forces in the future Weinberger said of the US Navy's operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform As far as we know they did abandon the site he said Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack jets attacked three Iranian oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday setting at least one of them ablaze regional shipping sources said Earlier today in Washington US Television networks had reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms and setting them ablaze The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan Rostam and Rakhsh offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a wave of jet fighter bombers Smoke was seen spiralling up from the Rostam field soon after At least one of the other two targets was also believed to be ablaze the sources said The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi air strikes in the past but Baghdad had not reported any southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway US Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a US-flagged ship President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the US Response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was jets raided three Iranian oil rigs in the southern Gulf on Monday setting at least one of them ablaze regional shipping sources said Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said Japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG the sources said They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan the sources said Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions traders said They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 21 pct a year from 1986 through 1991 Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987 when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase the sources said The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 195 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987 the sources said But when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market they said Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year of which 53 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia 33 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer the sources said The Japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 1752 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January the trade sources said Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement Under the present contract Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said When we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one television networks said on Monday that US forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled from the sea It said cautiously that US forces attacked late Sunday and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze as a result but CBS News and other networks said flatly that US forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms US officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a US-flagged ship President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the US response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the attack on a US-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile US Defense Department spokesman said he had no information on London oil and stock market rumors that the United States had launched a retaliatory strike against Iran for an attack on Friday that damaged a US shi I don't have anything Major Randy Morger said I have no information at all President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the US response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the attack on a US-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile Some of the rumors in the London markets were that the United States had launched an offshore strike against Iranian missile installations warned the United States on Monday against exacerbating the Gulf crisis saying it would endanger American interests Tehran Radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation said a spokesman for Iran's War Information Headquarters was responding to US Officials' remarks about taking military action against Iran The radio also quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Iran would respond decisively to any aggressive measure by the United States The radio said the spokesman made the statement following the attack on a Kuwaiti ship under the US Flag and comments by American officials on carrying out retaliatory action against Iran The spokesman said Any US Military aggression against Iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in the Persian Gulf and amidst this our principled policy is to confront any act which escalates tension President Ali Khamenei said he doubted the US Was in position to take violent action against Iran in the Gulf Tehran Radio reported The US Government is in a very difficult situation now and it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for a violent action the radio quoted him as saying in an interview with the English language daily Tehran Times In Washington President Ronald Reagan said he had decided on a response to Iran which the Americans blame for two missile attacks on US-related tankers in Kuwaiti waters last week but declined to say what the response was Khamenei said the US Government had to take some action to demonstrate its authority but on the other hand any violent act in the Persian Gulf will greatly harm long-term US Interests the radio monitored in Nicosia reported On efforts for a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war Khamenei said: Declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should be concurrent Formation of a panel to determine the aggressor necessarily preceeds the ceasefire He also rejected a peace-keeping committee or a buffer force as instruments to implement a July 20 UN Security Council order for a ceasefire in the seven-year-old Gulf war Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100000 barrels per day of crude Iran's national news agency IRNA said IRNA monitored in Nicosia quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200000 bpd later he said Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr at Neka near the Caspian and at Jolfa in north-west Iran Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum three pct from 45 pct on October 25 It said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes to non-Iraqi Arab ports would be reduced to 30 pct from 45 A conference spokesman declined to say why the move was taken at a time of heightened tension in the Gulf 
iraq,US crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said output for the second half of 1987 including that of Iraq will be above the official 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said Iraq refused to sign the pact by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 166 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987 In December OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 183 mln bpd now cut back to the third quarter target Ali told a news conference that including Iraq OPEC third quarter output will be between 175 and 177 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices Iraq has an official first half quota of 1466 mln bpd rising to 154 mln in the second half but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran which has a quota of 2255 mln bpd rising to 2369 mln in the second half Ali said the position of the 400000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude was fixed We will not discuss it There will not be any change he said Ali said the conference which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting We sweep a lot under the carpet he said Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting Ali said The problem of differentials is a real one I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9 Ali said If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue I will not do the work of another minister Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1 with a spread of 265 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes has rejected its new OPEC production quota set in Vienna for the second half of this year the official Iraqi news agency INA reported It quoted Oil Minister Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi who returned Sunday as saying Iraq will continue to adhere to its position considering itself as not included in the agreement Last December Iraq rejected its assigned first half 1987 quota of 1466 mln bpd and demanded a share equal to the 2255 mln bpd quota set for Iran its enemy in the nearly seven-year-old Gulf war The accord reached by OPEC ministers in Vienna Saturday set an output ceiling of 166 mln bpd for the group's 13 members from July to December raising Iraq's share to 154 mln bpd and Iran's to 2369 mln and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have agreed to initiate efforts to end the Iraq- Iran war UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rashid Abdulla al-Nuaimi said today on return from Belgrade We agreed during the talks to initiate efforts to end the Iraq-Iran war call for an international peace conference for the Middle East and to revive and support the Non-Aligned states the Emirates news agency WAM quoted him as saying He was the first senior UAE official to visit Yugoslavia since the two countries established diplomatic relations last November Chief Javier Perez de Cuellar is proposing a simultaneous ceasefire and inquiry into who started the Iran-Iraq war under a revised peace plan an Arab newspaper reported on Tuesday The United Arab Emirates daily al-Khaleej published what it said was the text of his nine-point peace plan The Al-Khaleej text referred to a ceasefire date as D-day and stipulated On D-day or another date to be agreed upon an impartial body to enquire into responsibility for the conflict would start work A choice could be made among existing bodies or an ad hoc body could be established the text said The text also envisaged setting a deadline for the body to complete its work General Javier Perez de Cuellar has proposed an impartial inquiry into the causes of the Gulf war while Iran and Iraq observe a ceasefire diplomatic sources said on Tuesday His nine-point plan a refinement of proposals he took to Tehran and Baghdad last month was delivered to the two sides last week with a request that they let him have their initial views before October 30 The proposals appeared to counter Iran's earlier offer of an undeclared cessation of hostilities if an inquiry into responsibility for the war was begun Iraq insisted on a formal unconditional ceasefire Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council on his return to New York on September 16 As in his original proposals the revised plan termed D-day a specific date to be agreed upon for the observance of a ceasefire diplomats said On a specific date after that which would have to be agreed the withdrawal of all forces to internationally recognized boundaries would begin and be completed within an agreed time frame according to the account of his proposals shells from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq fell on Kuwait's northern border on Tuesday but caused no casualties the Kuwait News Agency KUNA said quoting a Defense Ministry official There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in retaliation for US Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf on Monday Several shells fell in a random manner on the northern border of the country the official told KUNA It seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq No one was wounded and there were no losses Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier told he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil installations experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following US destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a US-flagged tanker The experts told Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors blockading its shipping or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues said Fred Axelgard a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) It's like a Greek tragedy said retired Adm Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area where the Navy began escorting US-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran which President Reagan could never accept US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd Young Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said We consider this matter closed he said Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the US reaction was measured reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed It had not taken this view after earlier clashes official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a US Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels The confrontation is a fact now What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration Krutikhin said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary

officials Energy Secretary John Herrington arrived in Rabat on Monday after a tour of the Gulf and the Middle East Herrington who is scheduled to meet King Hassan during his 24-hour official visit said on arrival he would discuss regional and international issues with Moroccan leaders Morocco is the last stop of a tour that has taken Herrington to Iraq Kuwait Qatar Bahrain Saudi Arabia and

israel,Israel's exports to the US can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's goal of economic independence is to be achieved said Gad Yaacobi Israeli minister of Economy and Communication Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the US were over 23 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total exports while imports from the US were around 18 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total I am convinced that Israel exports to the US can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality Yaacobi said While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a bottleneck to increasing exports to the US Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher US exports In the last ten years Israeli exports to the US rose fivefold from 417 mln dlrs to 23 billion in 1986 while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 18 billion last year Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War He said that the US/Israel Free Trade agreement passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994 would continue to facilitate the desired export growth Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the US and Europe enabling US firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel and vice-versa Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential Since 1973 the US has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts which were imposed on Israel he said Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential however Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994 based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the US free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking Yeutter made his remarks at a US-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord The Canadian-US pact signed by two sides two weeks ago has yet been approved by the US Congress and Canadian Parliament The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market they had better get serious about improving the GATT The pact with Israel he said is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT Yeutter said increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe He said a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity not only for advanced industrial nations but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade The legislation was prompted by a growing US trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto He said President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws and I believe that veto would be sustained 
italy,Compagnie Industriali Riunite (CIR) has asked Citicorp Investment Bank Ltd to arrange a 200 mln dlr syndicated loan facility which will have a final maturity of seven years Citicorp said Continental Illinois Ltd and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd will be coordinators for the facility which will be in the name of CIR International SA Luxembourg and guaranteeed by Compagnie Industriali Riunite SpA Banks will be able to terminate their participation at the end of year five or year six subject to four years prior notice There is an availability period of 12 months during which a commitment fee of 00625 pct per annum is payable on undrawn amounts Interest on the drawn loan will be 015 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate The borrower is the holding company for Carlo di Benedetti's various companies which include Ing C Olivetti EC SpA Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli commenting on speculation in the Italian press said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's overall 3211 billion lire deficit which compares with April's 2040 billion surplus could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags) rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment Sarcinelli said in a statement Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by non-banking capital outflows In practice it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders said the newspaper But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments merchant bank Mediobanca Spa <MDBIMI> said an Italian banking consortium has arranged 100 mln dlrs in financing for Banque Exterieure d'Algerie Mediobanca said in a statement that the financing was part of an accord reached last March between Italy and Algeria which agreed 300 mln dlrs of financing for Italian exports to Algeria Mediobanca said 12 Italian banks were participating in the consortium but gave no further details about the financing Among the banks are Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BANIMI> Banco di Sicilia and Efibanca Spa Spa

to improved sales and profits in the first six months of 1987 The group said in a statement that the cable sector showed sustained demand in the first six months of the year particularly in Italy Spain and Argentina It said cable sales in the US Market remained weak however Finance Minister Michael Wilson says the leading industrial nations have held a number of discussions on providing liquidity to the financial system after Monday's record stock market decline There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada the United States Japan Britain West Germany France and Italy) he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond

unassigned It was the first ECU-denominated offer by the Italian treasury in short-term paper Previous ECU-denominated offers have been in medium-term Treasury certificates The Treasury said at the time of the offer that it was in response to operators wishing to diversify their portfolios Gross rates on the bill which mature October 28 1988 is 9 pct giving an effective annual net yield of 788

told the cabinet on Monday he was worried about the increased tension in the Gulf but said America's retaliation against Iran had been limited A statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had been informed by the United States that it would take action against an Iranian target in the Gulf but had not known beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil platform The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible consequences of increased tension in the Gulf at the same time recognizing the limited character of the American military reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days the statement said Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution Italy has sent eight ships including three frigates and three minesweepers to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant shipping there overall balance of payments showed a 919 billion lire surplus in September against a deficit of 1026 billion in August provisional Bank of Italy figures showed The September surplus compared with a shortfall of 1697 billion lire in September 1986 For the first nine months of 1987 the overall balance of payments showed a deficit of 1921 billion lire against a 1725 billion deficit in the same 1986 period The central bank said Italy's one billion dlr Eurobond

Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added 
ivory-coast,IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus paid a brief weekend visit to the Ivory Coast during which he discussed the country's economic difficulties with President Felix Houphouet-Boigny Camdessus said he wished his visit could have been in more pleasant circumstances in remarks reported by the official Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin He added that the extremely steep fall in agricultural commodity markets had dealt a harsh blow this year to the Ivorian economy and because of this the country was experiencing a growth problem and difficulties with its international debt Last month the Ivory Coast informed its creditors it had to suspend payments on its foreign debt estimated at more than eight billion dlrs Camdessus said his agency had to study the problems of the Ivory Coast but a solution depended on a coordinated effort between the country itself the commercial banks other governments and international finance institutions He also disussed problems of developing countries in general with banking and government officials in Abidjan Coast rainfall this season has been less than in previous years but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee production has not suffered the official Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin reported The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if there is good rainfall in coming weeks Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest in northern savannah regions where the cotton crop has especially benefitted from the dry weather Fraternite Matin said Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213506 tonnes compared with 190000 tonnes in 1985/86 Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture had been little affected by the dry weather Coffee does not need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have been affected in some regions it added London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast 1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590000 tonnes which compares with 585000 estimated for 1985/86 It described early development of the new main crop as patchy The US Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast due to drought in the western part of the country It estimated the crop at 384 mln bags compared with the previous year's 433 mln bag harvest Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee crop as normal

japan,The House today supported a call for Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the world including in the Gulf House member approved a measure that would require Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of its gross national product The measure passed during consideration of the 1988-89 State Department funding bill would not require an increase but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense The Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law We don't have to bash the Japanese We have to show them how to share the burden of the defense of the free world said Rep Robert Dornan a California Republican The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on defense by itself or give the equivalent amount of money to the United States as a kind of security fee Finance Ministry is still asking financial institutions to limit speculative dollar dealings Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa

<PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium> in addition to the 683 billion yen already invested in the company The government and private interests will equally share the additional investment he said They will also provide equal shares in 63 billion yen in new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in Brazil in addition to the 457 billion yen already invested The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct the official said Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the current seven to eight pct but an agreement has yet to be reached industry sources said Under the rescue scheme for Asahan in which 911 billion yen has been invested Indonesia will also extend another 32 billion yen to the company This will raise Indonesia's investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an additional 65 billion yen in Albras in which investment now totals 932 billion yen but its stake will not change from 51 pct the official said The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects were larger than earlier expected reflecting Japan's desire to help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to stabilise sources of aluminium Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its aluminium demand which totals some 18 mln tonnes a year they said and Co Ltd <MITST> paid 15 mln dlrs in early May for a five pct stake in <Zoran Corp> a California-based maker of large scale

although details of the joint venture are not yet fixed Mitsui expects last year's 10 billion yen Japanese LSI market to grow quickly Zoran was founded in 1981 and now has about 100 employees he said repairs and inadequate inspection caused the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines Co Ltd <JAPNT> (JAL) Boeing 747 which killed 520 people the Japanese government said in a final official report The clear cause of the crash was faulty repair work by the Boeing Co <BA> said Shun Takeda the ministry of transport official leading the accident investigation committee But the report also criticised the ministry's inspectors for failing to carry out a full check of the repairs before signing the clearance sheet The aircraft hit Mount Osutaka north of Tokyo on August 12 1985 after a bulkhead separating the pressurised cabin from the unpressurised tail suddenly burst fracturing key navigation systems Only four people survived A Japan Air Lines spokesman declined comment on the report Boeing is expected to release a statement later today The report cleared the JAL crew of all responsibility In a separate set of recommendations the investigators said large aircraft operating in Japan should have fail-safe systems but did not say how this should be done A press statement by a group of lawyers representing victims of the crash criticised the report for not dealing in greater depth with the fail-safe aspect The lawyers said Boeing had showed it believed the crash was due to design defects by specifying two design modifications to prevent a recurrence in a memorandum filed in King County Washington Superior Court last March 24 They said similar official recommendations for fail-safe systems following two air disasters involving DC-10 aircraft near Paris in 1974 and at Chicago in 1979 had been rejected after objections from aircraft manufacturers The government investigators asked the ministry to formulate concrete guidelines for its inspectors An internal ministry memo earlier this year complained that inspectors were left too much on their own when making aircraft checks A Boeing team made repairs to the aircraft's aft bulkhead under JAL supervision and Transport Ministry inspectors approved the repairs without actually seeing them today's report said The inspectors were unable to check Boeing's work because the part repaired had been covered by a seal the report said Over time cabin pressurisation speeded up the process of metal fatigue in the repaired bulkhead Boeing issued an official statement on September 6 1985 saying the 1978 repairs it had carried out were faulty It did not link them with the crash custom-cleared trade surplus narrowed to 161 billion dlrs in the first 10 days of June from 197 billion a year earlier the Finance Ministry said The June interim surplus compares with a 176 billion dlr surplus in the same May period FOB exports in the first 10 days of June rose 176 pct from a year earlier to 605 billion dlrs

yen after a 57 pct rise in March from February April orders fell 13 pct from a year earlier after being unchanged in March The April drop was due mainly to a 129 pct decrease in orders from machine tool industries and a 153 pct drop in orders from car makers the spokesman said US Officials are looking to Japan for help in buttressing the world economy in the event of an American recession next year Japanese government sources said During a visit to the US Earlier this month Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Advisers chairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the US Enters recession next year Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did not expect a recession next year Volcker seemed to acknowledge that an economic downturn was at least a possibility the sources said Faced with with a huge budget deficit the US Has little room to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturn that might occur in 1988 It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concerned because US Inflation is already showing some signs of picking up one source said But Japan is also limited in what action it could take to help counteract a US Recession without running the risk of overstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation the sources said Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates are at record low levels In May M-2 money supply plus certificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 102 pct well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct Some government sources are also worried that the recently announced 6000 billion yen emergency economic package could push up land prices and the construction sector's inflation Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of about 10 pct in April but that could accelerate to 20 pct later this year under the impact of the emergency package one source said The 6000 billion yen package was generally well received in the US Although US Congressmen and businessmen told Kondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly sources said The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of public works spending in the package was taking place immediately they said US Congressmen were particularly interested in how much impact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade imbalance a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly given the many economic uncertainties involved the sources said While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in terms of volume some Congressmen expressed concern that it was not falling fast enough But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further rise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade imbalance

other currencies including bonds in Canadian dlrs and in European currencies he told the conference government should cut its consumer rice price if the official producer price is reduced next month Tetsuo Kondo director general of the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) told reporters Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due to the strong yen and lower oil prices Agriculture Ministry sources said the producer rice price paid to rice farmers would be cut after discussions by the Rice Price Council an advisory body to the ministry on July 1 and 2 The consumer rice price is usually set in December Co <BA> said in a statement it has yet to see the official Japanese government report on the crash of a Japan Air Lines (JAL) Boeing 747 in which 520 died However it said it had agreed with an earlier draft report that the accident was caused by incorrect repairs which remained undetected during scheduled inspections The final report released today said faulty repairs to the plane in 1978 by Boeing and inadequate inspection by Transport Ministry inspectors caused the 1985 crash the worst single air disaster in aviation history Boeing said it did not believe a similar accident could occur under any foreseeable operating conditions but said it had made tests and provided equipment for new planes and for planes already in service to ensure it could not happen again could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan the US And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies an advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed An EPA official told the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the US Failed to restructure their economies The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national product (GNP) in 1993 the report said It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993 If the two nations restructured their economies the dollar would remain stable in real terms while reducing Japan's current-account surplus to 21 pct of GNP in 1993 This scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 35 pct a year It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2000 if the adjustments were made must try harder to reduce its trade surplus or the yen will come under renewed upward pressure Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs In the fiscal year ended March 31 the surplus totalled 9376 billion dlrs or about 45 pct of GNP The 6000 billion yen economic stimulation package the government unveiled late last month would help slash Japan's current account surplus by five to six billion dlrs he said Tokyo stock market will probably not make significant gains next week and may suffer a temporary correction brokers said Dashed hopes of a further cut in Japan's 25 pct discount rate cut and a growing conviction the dollar will remain firm against the yen in the near-term has created a measure of uncertainty over the market's future brokers said Everybody is just trying to think through things and see exactly what is going on said a broker at Sanyo Securities Co Ltd There is a lot of confusion he added This uncertainty was spotlighted by violent swings in stock prices over the last two days Today the 225-share average ended 46243 points lower at 2528812 People expect a correction next week They don't care if the market falls to 24000 the Sanyo broker said There is always enough money waiting to get into the market to fill any correction Tokyo stock prices owe a major part of their two-year bull run to repeated cuts in the discount rate which diverts money from bank deposits to the stock market and cuts the cost of borrowing boosting domestic demand and imports Fund managers are restructuring their investment portfolios to sell domestic-related issues and include a few more exporters said Prudential Bache Securities' Hank Sawa Tokyo-based foreign exchange dealers predict the dollar is unlikely to fall sharply in the near term thus convincing stock market investors to buy electronics precision instrument machinery and some other export-oriented manufacturing shares brokers said Some people are awaiting the results of proposed protectionist US Trade legislation in July for clues to the currency direction a broker at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd said Optical Co Ltd <OOPTT> predicted parent company current profit of 550 billion yen in the year ending October 31 1987 up 12 pct from a year earlier assuming a yen/dollar rate of 147 yen in the second half a company spokesman told Sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 122 billion yen up 09 pct from a year earlier But net profit will fall 717 pct to three billion yen in 1986/87 from a year earlier when the company made a 1059 billion net profit due to sales of real estate assets worth seven billion yen the spokesman said The precision instrument maker will retain 13 yen dividend for 1986/87 the spokesman said It earlier reported parent company net profit of 134 billion yen in the six months ended April 30 down 855 pct from a year earlier on sales of 6092 billion down 01 pct The poor net was mainly due to a fall to 45 mln yen in extraordinary profit in the first half against 770 billion of such profit a year earlier due mainly to sales of assets The drop in first half sales was due to the yen's rise against the dollar which cut sales by some 430 billion yen The dollar averaged 157 yen against 192 a year earlier Motors Ltd <ISUMT> forecast a parent company net loss of 15 billion yen in the year ending October 31 1987 against a 398 billion loss a year earlier assuming a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen a spokesman said Sales in 1986/87 are estimated at 910 billion yen down 102 pct from a year earlier The automaker earlier reported a parent company net loss of 1292 billion in the six months ended April 30 1987 against a 165 billion yen profit a year earlier on sales of 44390 billion down 159 pct from a year earlier The poor first half performance was due to the yen's rise against the dollar which cut 8427 billion yen off sales the spokesman said The average yen/dollar rate rose to 158 yen in the first half from 207 a year earlier First half car exports fell to 68445 from 82093 a year earlier mainly due to drop in exports to the US While domestic sales rose to 30643 from 29836 Truck exports fell to 108782 from 127903 because a two-year contract to sell a total of 40000 trucks to China ended last year and domestic sales fell to 55925 from 61954 The company estimated sales at 207000 cars in 1986/87 down 52 pct from a year earlier and 339000 trucks down 98 pct the spokesman said He gave no estimate of exports commercial creditor banks confirmed an earlier commitment to extend some 360 mln dlrs in new loans to Argentina banking sources said The commitment will represent a part of the 195 billion dlrs in new loans to Argentina agreed to by 350 banks worldwide last April 24 the sources said The 350 banks were supposed to confirm their Argentina loan commitments by June 17 About 91 pct of them have already done so but it may take some more time before all have confirmed their intentions the sources added oil companies are starting campaigns to market 100 octane gasoline to meet growing domestic demand for higher quality motor fuel oil sources said Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this summer starting with <Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20 Showa Shell Sekiyu KK <SHOLT> introduced its Formula Shell 98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a higher price than regular octane gasoline which has prompted other oil firms to offer a rival product the sources said We have received a good response from consumers of Formula Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel consumption Showa Shell said Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre 15 yen higher than regular gasoline and has already achieved a 38 pct share of Japan's high octane gasoline market it said High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total gasoline sales in Japan it added Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct immediately after the launch of its Idemitsu 100 Nippon Oil Co Ltd <NPOLT> said it will launch its 100 octane gasoline on July 1 aiming for an increase in high octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline sales The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station construction in the next two to three years Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline production quotas an official at a major oil company said An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry including the lifting of gasoline production quotas to help oil companies increase their international competitiveness Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers Nippon Oil Idemitsu and Showa Shell suffered supply shortages under the production quota guideline in fiscal 1986 ended last March Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 25 pct from the previous year according to a MITI report crushers bought 8000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment from the last-half of July to September trade sources said Price details were not available group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress saying it would curb their exports slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt Mario Rodriguez Montero president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto Rodriguez said as yet the administration is not in a veto frame of mind Pentagon has stopped approving any new military contracts to Japan's Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> over a Toshiba subsidiary's transfer of submarine technology to the Soviet Union a senior defense official said We are not approving any new contracts (with Toshiba) pending a satisfactory resolution of this entire matter Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Stephen Bryen told confirming published reports on the matter The temporary ban which Bryen said has been in effect unofficially since April could cost Toshiba hundreds of mlns of dlrs in electronics business with the Pentagon including a pending 100 mln dlr Air Force deal for small computers Bryen said the US military services have not signed any contracts with Toshiba since April when publicity arose over subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co's alleged sale to Moscow of milling machines which will grind silent submarine propellers The Japanese government has been investigating the case and it was previously reported that Toshiba Machine sold four large milling machines to the Soviet Union in late 1983 or early 1984 But Bryen told in an interview that the Pentagon has now been informed by Japanese police that at least four more smaller machines capable of making such precision propellers were also sold to the Kremlin apparently in 1984 There may be even more beyond that I don't know yet Bryen said Toshiba is known to be seeking a US Air Force contract for 90000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs The Air Force has called for new bids on that contract partly because of the Toshiba investigation Pentagon officials said The officials who asked not to be identified said the computer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding because of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by US import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics Two days ago three US senators said they wanted a temporary ban on all US imports of Toshiba Corp products including television sets and videotape recorders Senators Jake Garn of Utah Richard Shelby of Alabama and John Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to a major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology transfer and Pentagon officials have told that some of the state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on Soviet attack submarines The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba Machine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one year The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was involved in the original technology transfer providing vital computer software to be used with the Japanese milling equipment But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen said that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more recent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment for Tokyo stocks are mixed this week with investors trying to figure out the future of the yen/dollar exchange rate and digest the implications of OPEC's latest accord on crude output and pricing brokers said They said the market should extend the dull trend it has been in since the 225-share index fell rapidly from the record close at 2592942 on June 17 It ended at 2490272 on Saturday and fell further this morning to close at 2470768 in an uncertain reaction to the weaker yen and the weekend OPEC accord Brokers said attention could focus more on the cheaper less well-known stocks in the exchange's first and second sections which were generally showing more resilience The second section index in contrast to the first closed at a record 240464 on June 26 surpassing the peak set on June 17 of 240171 Probably shares of companies involved in the domestic economy are a good bet said a broker at Daiwa Securities Co Ltd He said his observation was based on figures showing that business activity in Japan is booming The government said on Friday that department store and supermarket sales rose 75 pct in May from a year earlier while orders received by Japan's 50 major construction firms in the same month were up 76 pct year on year Brokers expected more such figures but said many stocks linked to domestic demand remain overpriced They are hard to find but companies with an attractive niche in the domestic economy unaffected by currency movements are the best bet said a broker at a foreign securities house who declined to be identified But sharp rises in money supply and voracious domestic consumption are stirring inflation fears The consumer price index rose 02 pct in May from April the third consecutive month on month increase Although investors are not unduly worried about inflation which erodes the real value of stock holdings they say rising prices arouse concern that interest rates may climb The recent market advances have been assuming a further cut in Japan's 25 pct discount rate Such assumptions have now died discouraging investors brokers said If oil prices rise the stock market in Japan could suffer a downturn as higher production costs stir inflation But share prices of Japan's oil importing companies may also firm brokers said I have never been able to justify this because it should mean that the cost of importing rises said a broker at Yamaichi Securities Co It just always happens Export-oriented companies may continue their recent rally if the dollar climbs against the yen But prices of many blue chip exporters have risen fast over the last two weeks making them look less attractive brokers said However if the dollar falls to about 140 or 138 yen the market index may rally brokers said A lower dollar could damp down rising capital outflows into dollar investments from Japan's stock and bond markets brokers said And as the yen/dollar rate is supposed to reflect the balance of trade between the United States and Japan a lower dollar would bring more pressure on Japan to expand its demand for American imports by stimulating its local economy brokers said If the dollar falls buy domestic if it rises maybe buy a few exporters said one foreign broker has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 oil traders said They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 166 mln bpd from the 183 mln agreed in December There are light oversupplies now but OPEC  Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter and is in effect putting pressure on end-users a European crude oil trader said In Tokyo one oil analyst said There's no reason to expect a weak market from now on A Japanese oil trader also based in Tokyo said We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai a benchmark crude they expect price increases over the next few days August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 1735 dlrs above Friday's 1715-20 range but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 1742 Even prices of light Mideast grades such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes are expected to improve from recent weak positions 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least They said that after initial jumps they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and US Stockbuilding for winter they added There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high said an international trader in Tokyo Another Tokyo trader was less bullish For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat A Singapore trade source said There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota was a bearish factor to be considered Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies dealers said agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said will ratify the 1986 International Cocoa Agreement (ICCA) with effect from July 1 and will renew its membership in the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) Foreign Affairs Ministry officials said They said Japan would participate in an ICCO meeting on July 13 in London to revise ICCO buffer stock policy The 1986 ICCA has been in effect since January 1987 Government approval to participate in the ICCO was delayed by parliamentary debate over the sales tax issue the officials said Steel Ltd> said it has agreed to supply technology to manufacture thin-walled copper tubing used in air conditioners and refrigeration units to <Halstead Industries Inc> in Zelienople Pennsylvania Total demand for copper tubing in the US Is 25000 tonnes a month of which 5000 is for the thin-walled type Kobe said in a statement The two companies are studying joint partial production of Kobe's thin-walled copper tubing in the US Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy central bank officials said Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an announcement effect in which we would reassure the market of the fact that we have not changed our policy stance a senior central bank official told The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the interbank market today the officials said The central bank was concerned about growing market expectations of higher interest rates which were in part responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices the officials said But money traders said the market generally shrugged off the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far below prevailing market rates The rate on the key three-month CDs in the primary market was 408/00 pct while the bank's bid was 375 pct they said The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact because it was regarded as a routine operation they said The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip any further a bank manager said adding that the prevailing market expectation of higher rates will remain If this is the case the three-month CD rate will stay above four pct for the time being he said Bank of Japan will tomorrow sell 1200 billion yen in bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 2100 billion money market traders said Of the total 800 billion yen will yield 36004 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in 34-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 3 The other 200 billion yen will yield 36003 pct in 43-day repurchase accords maturing on August 12 The remaining 200 billion yen will yield 36503 pct in 50-day repurchase agreements maturing on August 19 The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 35625 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and 36250 pct on two-month bills They attributed the projected surplus mainly to 1900 billion yen of government tax allocations to local governments and public bodies Corp <SNET> will issue a 75 billion yen 15-year unsecured convertible

damaged mutual security US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Weinberger told a press conference that exports of Japanese machines designed to make Soviet submarines quieter and harder to detect had been a serious blow But he said he was encouraged by the punishment dealt to Toshiba Machine Co a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> for the illegal exports and by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's assurances that action would be taken to keep it from happening again The government has barred Toshiba Machine from exporting to Communist countries for a year and said it intends to strengthen and expand its export control system Weinberger gave no details of the anti-submarine program In his talks with Japanese Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara he said he made a pitch for American companies seeking to build Japan's new fighter aircraft for the 1990's I assured Minister Kurihara that I support his plans to increase Japanese air defence capabilites and that I believe American aircraft can do this he said The Japanese industry argues it should develop the fighter plane on its own Motor Corp <MAZTT> has signed an agreement to import coal from <Coalex Pty Ltd> of Australia

usually for long periods Bank of Japan has become increasingly worried about a possible crash of high-flying financial markets Bank of Japan sources said We're afraid that someday the bubble will burst and that the deflationary impact on the economy will be very disastrous one source said They said the central bank has embarked on a delicate policy -- it wants to deflate the speculation that has pumped up prices sharply in recent months without bursting the bubble Stock prices plunged 39331 points today extending the sharp declines of earlier this month as the market speculated that interest rates would rise The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy central bank officials said Today's CD buying operation was designed to reassure the market the Bank has not changed its policy a senior central Bank official told There is a possibility that a deflationary impact would permeate the economy if the prices of existing assets collapsed the Bank of Japan said earlier this month in its annual economic report Such a possibility has been heightened by what the Bank sees as excessive speculation in stock bond and land prices Over the last two years the stock market average has doubled driving price/earnings ratios to over 70 compared with about 15 on Wall Street Bond yields have dropped sharply while land prices in Tokyo have soared The excessive speculation means the markets are increasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus more vulnerable one central bank source said A collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of what little confidence they have in the economy after the yen-induced recession of the past year private economists said Some hard-pressed exporters already make greater profits through financial dealings than from their basic businesses they said There seems to be an accelerated demand for money to support transactions in shares bonds land and other existing assets which has little bearing on value added and therefore on GNP the Bank of Japan said in its report The increased inclination of investors to seek capital gains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assets could have dangerous implications for the economy it added In the Bank's view a major reason behind skyrocketing prices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in the market that interest rates were heading inexorably lower Mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed by excessive liquidity the Central Bank's board recently decided it had to spell out clearly to the markets that a further discount rate cut was not in the offing one source said But the bank had to do that without tightening monetary policy and running the risk of a market collapse This was achieved partly by a rise in short-term interest rates which Bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and to a change in market expectations While denying the bank was tightening monetary policy a senior source welcomed the change in market expectations The source acknowledged the shift may have been caused partly by the decision to press commercial banks to limit lending in the July/September period Faster than expected economic growth and a strong dollar also played a part In the longer run the Central Bank is counting on a gradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from the financial markets into productive areas like capital spending one Bank of Japan economist said But while it waits for that to occur over the next six months it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetary policy that could collapse the market and lead to recession Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's diminishing hopes of overhauling the tax system have been dealt a serious blow by reports of sharply higher than expected tax revenues in 1986/87 government officials said Nakasone has argued that the tax system must be reformed to provide the revenue for more than 1000 billion yen of tax cuts promised in the government's emergency economic package last month But his argument has been undercut by reports that the 1986/87 tax take was as much as 2500 billion yen more than expected That means the government should have more than enough money in the fiscal year ending next March to pay for the planned tax cuts without having recourse to the unpopular tax measures proposed by Nakasone one official said The Prime Minister has proposed an indirect tax and the abolition of tax breaks on small savings as ways of raising revenue to offset the tax cuts But stiff opposition has forced him to shelve the idea of an indirect tax at least for the time being He still hopes to gain parliamentary approval next month to abolish tax breaks on small savings The higher than expected revenues in 1986/87 partly stemmed from increased receipts from land and securities taxes as prices of both shares and land soared one official said But corporate tax revenues have also been more buoyant than expected perhaps indicating the recession of the last year induced by the strong yen was not as bad as thought he said The final figures for 1986/87 revenues are due to be released by the Finance Ministry on July 1 The higher revenues last fiscal year have also undercut attempts by the Finance Ministry's budget bureau to reduce investment spending by government departments in the 1988/89 budget several officials said A budget bureau official said the bureau still wanted to stick with its so-called minus-ceiling policy which calls for government departments to reduce investment spending by five pct a year But he acknowledged this would be difficult given the sharp increase in revenues last fiscal year and heavy

yen in interest payments said an international agreement on loans to Poland was needed before Tokyo extended fresh loans to Warsaw to help a Japanese car maker set up a factory there Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone explained the conditions during the first round of talks with the visiting Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski foreign ministry sources said They quoted Jaruzelski as saying of a private Japanese plan to export car production facilities to Poland If this project goes well it will serve as an engine in future economic relations between Poland and Japan Nakasone speaking of the possibility of resuming extending official loans to Poland said It is necessary that an agreement should be established at an international arena such as the Paris Club of creditor nations He hoped that such an agreement will be achieved at an early date but he did not make firm commitments about Japanese loans the sources said Along with western nations Japan has witheld new official credits to Poland since February 1982 following the 1981 declaration of martial law in Poland The Japanese car maker Daihatsu Motor <DMOTT> and three trading houses including Mitsui Co Ltd plan to export production facilities to Poland's state-owned car maker FSO to make the Charade minicar according to Mitsui officials We are pushing the plan on the premise of an official credit to be extended

Japanese competitors in the new promising business of bringing asset rich Japanese investors to the US financial futures markets Japan allowed local financial institutions last month to start using overseas futures in currencies bonds and stocks to help them manage their bulging foreign portfolios US investment banks are going to take advantage We've been in the business for two decades the Japanese have not said Eugene Atkinson president of Goldman Sachs Japan Corp Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into the new markets but in fact participation so far has been slow Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said Koichi Kane Executive Vice President of Nomura Securities International said They're still in a starting up period They're testing the water Atkinson added But once they start the Japanese are likely to become very big players opening up lucrative business opportunities he said US investment banking sources said the slow start is understandable because US institutional investors too are fairly new to the market Futures markets have a long history in the US but because of the high risks involved American pension funds and mutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until relatively recently a US investment bank futures analyst said In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed for the slow start the Japanese sources said Japan is liberalizing its financial markets but domestic financial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers in Japan for overseas futures markets This may change next year when bankers speculate that securities houses will be permitted to enter this line of business While the Japanese are out of the business the Americans have moved in with First Boston Corp Salomon Brothers Inc Goldman Sachs and Co Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and PainWebber Inc leading the charge they said In the US Nikko Securities Co International Inc is preparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of Trade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for futures products Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said Nomura Japan's largest securities house has not yet decided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the US to establish closer links between Japanese investors and the US futures markets Kane said The evening session of CBT inaugurated recently to coincide with early Tokyo business hours has increased Japanese participation to some extent but the brokerage issue is still a hurdle the Japanese sources said High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures market so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime trading session in Chicago if possible they said The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and establishing channels to pay fees and margins but harmonizing clerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and Chicago are proving to be a burden the sources said Some Japanese banks which are largely barred from the securities industry in Japan have contemplated buying into the US brokerage business the Japanese sources said One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions which was also a spur for US commercial banks to get into the brokerage business they said The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or to go into a business tie-up said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd in New York One trust bank source said total fees could amount to around one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets fully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively many foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth capital assets but the futures brokerage business to be a different story Japanese banking sources said They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to difficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future some US brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13 dlrs per contract below the break-even level they said Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to approach Japanese financial institutions about possible tie-ups a futures indusry source in Chicago said But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small capital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese nervous about a capital link Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage business once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts growing fast and proves to be profitable they said But the big question they added is whether the Japanese government would let banks engage in this new risky business subsidiary of (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co Ltd) and privately-held (Murex Corp) jointly announced they signed an agreement giving Kyowa exclusive rights in Japan to market certain Murex products to detect AIDS The companies estimated that Japanese clinicians will perform a minimum of 28 mln AIDS tests a year The Murex products must be approved by Japanese authorities before they are sold in Japan seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to a record 32 pct in May the worst level since the government started compiling unemployment statistics in 1953 the government's Management and Coodination Agency said The May rate surpassed the previous record of 30 pct marked set in January and April this year It was also up sharply from 27 pct a year earlier Unadjusted May unemployment totalled 191 mln people up from 190 mln in April and 162 mln a year earlier An agency official blamed industrial restructuring and the strong yen for the rise in unemployment The seasonally adjusted male unemployment rate in May rose to a record 32 pct surpassing the previous record 30 pct set in July 1986 This compares with 29 pct in April and 27 pct a year earlie Unadjusted male unemployment totalled 112 mln up 180000 from a year earlier The female unemployment rate in May was unchanged from April at a record 31 pct A year ago the rate was 28 pct Unadjusted female unemployment rose 100000 to 790000 The yen's appreciation continued to affect employment in manufacturing industries and the total employed in May fell 210000 or 15 pct from a year earlier to 1410 mln Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to meet for talks The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock market There is no special worry about the stock market in Tokyo he added Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan and stability of exchange rates Asked if the US Had contacted Japan after the stock market plunge in New York Miyazawa said there was not any contact Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker on Sunday that some nations were not abiding by the spirit of the Louvre Accord were just aimed at reaffirming that agreement The agreement to cooperate in stabilising currencies was reached in Paris in February this year The finance minister made the remark at a news conference which followed a morning cabinet meeting said it understood why the US Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday Japan deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the ships navigating in the Gulf understands the circumstances that have led the United States government to take these measures the Foreign Ministry said in a statement The statement added that the threat to free and safe navigation had increased after the missile attack on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday Inc <CANNT> said it will stop making Japanese language word processors with retail prices below 50000 yen and consign production instead to <Kyushu Matsushita Electronic Co Ltd> a 5175-pct owned unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd <MCT> A Canon spokesman said the move reflects intense price competition as Canon Casio Computer Co Ltd <CACTT> and others compete in the growing market for low-end processors Canon will focus production on more expensive and sophisticated models which have more generous profit margins he said the dollar goes the way of Wall Street Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a serious way Japan investment managers say The Japanese the dominant foreign investors in US Dollar securities have already sold US Equities But if the dollar falls steeply which did not happen yesterday Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from US Shares said Akira Kawakami deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department An unstable lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in US Bonds Japan-US Interest rate differentials which currently look wide enough mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability said Kawakami US Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major US Institutional and individual investors he said The effect should be to rule out any US Interest rate rise But most Japanese investors in US Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable he said The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday most are still looking for chances to lighten their US Stock inventories Hiromitsu Sunada manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1738 the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914 Investment in US Stocks and bonds is difficult considering the dangers said Katsuhiko Okiyama deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street the managers said The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks which is what investors have been waiting for The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 63 pct yield for the 51 pct 89th bond they said The basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has not changed said Norio Okutsu assistant general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department But new outflows of funds to the US Will be decreasing However this was already evident three months ago he said Corp <NIPNT> will supply <Matra-Harris Semiconducteurs SA(A)> (MHS) of France with manufacturing technology for 16-bit microchips used in microcomputers an NEC spokesman said MHS a joint venture between France's MATRA <MATRPA> and Harris Corp <HRS> of the US Will manufacture and market globally a microcomputer based on NEC's Micron PD 78312 and Micron PD78310 chips MHS will pay NEC an undisclosed sum for the technology Finance Ministry will take a wait-and-see stance on Tokyo Stock Exchange movement although it is gravely concerned about the sharp fall in stock prices a senior Ministry official said The official who declined to be identified told reporters the 73 pct drop in Tokyo stock prices this morning was caused primarily by psychological factors following the 225 pct fall in New York stock prices overnight He said the Ministry is in close contact with the Tokyo Stock Exchange but has no plans yet to take any specific measures regarding the fall Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation We must watch things a little longer New York is down 22 pct London 10 pct while compared to this Japan is seven pct down Kyodo quoted him as telling reporters Asked if he agreed with analysts who called the stock sell-off Black Monday Nakasone said: Compared with times past economics have changed completely He rejected a comparison between the present situation and the stock market collapse of 1929 and the recession which followed of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he welcomed Monday's US And West German joint confirmation of their commitment to the Louvre accord Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were excessively concerned about the economic future The Bank of Japan will continue to adhere to a system of policy coordination based upon the Louvre accord of February he said The accord called for stability in foreign exchange rates Exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady recovery he said Stock Exchange president Michio Takeuchi said the exchange has no immediate plans to suspend trading to cool off panic stock selling However he said Tokyo may consider such a measure if the London and New York exchanges are closed overnight I don't think it will happen he added He also told reporters the exchange will relax margin requirements effective on Wednesday to encourage stock buying Takeuchi said the sharp fall in stock prices was mostly due to psychological factors We need to keep close watch on market movement but we expect the market will stabilise soon he said adding that individual investors should remain calm It is advisable to wait for an autonomous recovery of the market he said The margin requirement in cash will be reduced to 50 pct from 70 pct while the margin collateral requirement in equity will rise to 70 pct from 60 pct effective on Wednesday he said Takeuchi also said the exchange has no specific plan to take coordinated action with the New York and London exchanges to help stabilise stock prices The drop on Wall Street was caused by various factors but was primarily the result of a correction of overvalued share prices he said The current stock price plunge cannot compare with the Great Depression as the economic environment is very different he added The exchange has not changed plans to introduce stock futures trading next year despite press reports that the Wall Street fall was linked with futures trading he said Motor Co Ltd <NSANT> said it has started to market a remodelled version of its four wheel drive (4WD) Safari vehicle in Japan Nissan said in a statement it hopes to sell 250 vehicles a month in Japan It also plans soon to start exporting 3400 vehicles a month to the Australian Middle East and Asian markets under the name Patrol a spokesman said It will sell the vehicle in Europe sometime in the future with shipments from <Motor Iberica SA> its Spanish unit The volume for Europe will be set later Finance Ministry plans to examine how life insurance companies realised capital gains through transactions undertaken in June just before the yen bond market began to fall sharply a senior Ministry official said The move is aimed at cooling fierce competition in the field and will pave the way for a Ministry system to check that insurers do not inflate investment returns on the accounts to attract investors he said Some insurers transfer part of their unrealised gains from general accounts to the variable life accounts violating their internal regulations industry sources said The eight major local life-insurers which offer variable life policies here realised an average return of 2101 pct on such policies in the year ended September The Ministry will scrutinise the policies of 17 local and foreign life insurers which offer the variable life schemes Japan has 23 major local life insurers none of which is listed on the stock market in Japan's M-2 plus certificates of deposit (CD) money supply in the October to December period is not expected to accelerate but will remain at high levels between 11 and 12 pct a senior Bank of Japan official said The central bank will keep a watch on high growth in liquidity because this is a factor that may cause rises in prices of goods he said The September growth of 111 pct year on year announced earlier today should not be taken as implying that the money supply has started to expand very rapidly he said In August the rate of increase was 110 pct economists fear a world recession if stock exchanges continue to plunge Others are more sanguine The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying personal assets and dampening consumption The real economic effects can be significant -- the destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy said an economist at a US Securities house But other economists said such fears were overblown Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal assets that much negative impact could be observed (in the US) said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing such a major role in the entire US Gross national product (GNP) Honda said The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on Monday was sparked by fears the US Economy is heading for a recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assets is less than in the US And the total weight of individuals' holdings in the stock market is less so there will be less damage than in the US said an economist at one of Japan's major brokerage houses Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic demand so while there could be some impact from the reduction of assets value it would not be a major impact said the Bank of Tokyo's Honda Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in US Interest rates as a positive sign for the US Economy US Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling that interest rates have hit their ceiling and the US Economy is strong so there should be no direct impact from the collapse of share prices said Toshiaki Kakimoto Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Some economists suggested that should markets continue to slump the major industrial nations may have to discuss possible joint lowering of official discount rates Until last week a discussion of lower rates was unthinkable now it's not said the Japanese brokerage house economist There has been a move from the purely rational to the emotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare said the foreign economist It will require strong global leadership by politicians to snuff out he said However previously the stocks correction was due to fears of higher interest rates a possible resurgence of inflation and the depreciation of the dollar said Nobuyuki Ueda senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of the US Economy Ueda said If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future movement of the economy this decline will have very significant implications for the US Economy he said If the low levels hold those who were keeping consumption high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier If the paper gains aren't there people won't spend A US Recession could then trigger similar declines in other economies some economists said I don't know if a possible recession in the US Would trigger a world recession because other nations such as Japan are showing good economic performance LTCB's Ueda said But we can't rule out the possibility because the US Is still playing a very dominant role in the world economy and monetary authorities today staged a concerted effort to calm spreading panic on Japanese stock exchanges but market analysts said there were limits to their ability to succeed The ability of the Big Four (Japanese securities houses) and the Finance Ministry is limited said Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Peter Morgan Finance Ministry officials asked the big four securities companies this afternoon to help calm panic selling on the Tokyo Stock Exchange ministry officials said Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone was quoted by Kyodo News Service as saying he was watching the stock market situation But he rejected comparisons with the 1929 stock market collapse and subsequent recession Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by downturns in New York and London because there are clear signs of a Japanese economic recovery and exchange rate stability Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita also tried to calm the panic saying in a statement that world stock markets were excessively concerned about the economic future Traditionally the four big houses -- Nomura Securities Co Ltd Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd Daiwa Securities Co Ltd and Nikko Securities Co Ltd -- have influenced the market because of their sheer size and overwhelming market share This strength has in the past made it possible for the brokerages to calm down markets under guidance from the Finance Ministry analysts said But the analysts questioned whether the brokerages which have already suffered heavy losses from falling bond markets over the past year would have the strength this time to turn things around The question is are the Japanese brokerages strong enough to force investors to buy said Johsen Takahashi research director at the Mitsubishi Research Institute If we consider that they have suffered serious losses in the bond markets and in their US Investments it is debatable whether they they could support buying he said We can support things to some extent but we can't completely suppress selling said one Japanese broker Some analysts said the high percentage of shares cross-held by financial institutions and other corporations could have a stabilising effect on the market Some 80 pct of shares are held by corporate shareholders said Keikichi Honda general manager of the Bank of Tokyo Ltd's economic research division This is a tightly woven textile In its own way it is stronger than Wall Street But other analysts expressed doubt about this argument If a high percent of shares is cross held everything happens at the edges and the relative moves can be larger said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson Selling will drive prices down an enormous distance because of no liquidity You don't need big volume to get big declines in the market -- you just need a huge imbalance between sellers and buyers said Barclay's Morgan Shares held by what are termed stable shareholders or banks and other companies with which a firm does business might also find their way onto the market if the outlook gets bad enough some analsyst said Closely held shares could become unclosely held said Morgan But he said such a prospect is unlikely right now because companies with their improved earnings prospects do not need to sell shares for cash flow reasons Japanese economy is firmly on the recovery path supported by robust domestic demand the Bank of Japan said in a regular monthly report The report said industrial production is strengthening as manufacturing companies have almost completed adjustments of their plant and equipment investment while non-manufacturing firms have continued to be positive in their capital spending Strong domestic demand such as consumer spending and housing investment will more than offset declining exports the central bank report said It also noted the continued rise in domestic wholesale prices and money supply Tokyo stock prices will prevent the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues government and private economists said A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major deflationary impact on the real economy they said Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently maintained that they had no plans to raise the 25 pct discount rate many in the markets have thought otherwise Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance higher rates on commercial bills dealers said But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15 pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to raise the discount rate now despite its concerns about a renewed outbreak of inflation dealers and economists said Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount rate increase A senior government economist suggested that both the US And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices They need to support the stock and security markets he said But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change policy for the moment although one admitted that the central bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices continue to plunge during the rest of the week Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago With the economy recovering strongly the steep drop in stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and business confidence one government economist said There will be some impact on the real economy but it won't be that big said another Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their own although they do participate through trust funds and other investment vehicles And while many manufacturing firms turned to financial market investments for profits during last year's economic downturn the recent rebound has allowed them to refocus their attention on their core businesses he said Paradoxically it is the pick-up in the economy that is partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have shifted funds away from financial investments to increase inventories and step up capital spending one government economist said In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price drop the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation one central bank official said That will at least take a couple of days if not weeks he said and West on Monday decided to go ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Representatives of the US The Soviet Union the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants but by joining them Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich West Germany and is scheduled for completion by 1990 an IAEA statement said Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries Dieter Sigmar a leading US Fusion researcher said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste While today's nuclear power plants need uranium mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water according to experts Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita chosen on Monday to be Japan's next prime minister will face a tough test in managing Japan's economy from the very start of his two-year term economists and businessmen said Takeshita told a news conference on Tuesday that he would do his best to continue the domestic reforms and external policies of Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone However leading Japanese businessmen called on Takeshita to outdo Nakasone by showing stronger leadership Takeshita should not merely follow the Nakasone policies but should cope with mounting economic issues with a new vision and policies Takashi Ishihara chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development said in a statement Economists generally agreed that there will be no major changes in Japan's economic policies under a new leader However expectations are high among major industries for new initiatives by Takeshita for immediate and effective measures to solve economic problems such as trade friction with the US Administrative and tax reforms and soaring land prices Eishiro Saito chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) urged Takeshita to succeed in unifying the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as soon as possible to tackle difficult tasks Regarding foreign economic polices Yoshitoki Chino chairman of the Japan Securities Dealers Association said Takeshita should come up with economic measures well before economic issues develop into problems Behind those calls on Takeshita for prompt action are doubts about his capability in handling international issues due to his lack of experience in diplomacy economists said Economists said foreign countries should be patient with Takeshita who is widely known as an ultra-cautious politician Takeshita has repeatedly said There should be consensus before taking action Takeshita has so far failed to unveil specific measures to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus economists said He has said Japan will continue to stimulate the economy and to open the market wider to foreign products massive plunge in Tokyo stock prices on Tuesday could rob the Government of much-needed revenue to spur Japan's economy and may hurt banks' ability to lend abroad analysts polled by said The Japanese Government is depending on the sale of NTT (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp <NCCTT>) shares for much of its public spending budget said Shigeo Suzuki a deputy general manager at the Industrial Bank of Japan Japan had hoped to raise at least 5000 billion yen from the sale of 195 mln NTT shares on November 10 However the 149 pct plunge in the Tokyo share index today has made such plans look unrealistic analysts said The government could defer the sale of NTT or they could offer fewer shares said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd Honda said another possibility is that the underwriters handling the NTT sale would have to pay the Government the amount it expected to get and bear the brunt of any losses themselves That is what underwriting means he added A Finance Ministry official confirmed that the government planned to go ahead with its sale of NTT shares on November 10 Another possible effect of Tokyo's stock tumble would be to seriously undermine the asset base of Japanese banks The banks lend money all over the world and regard the market value of stock holdings as assets analysts said Japanese banks make loans using perhaps as much as 60 to 70 pct of the market value of their unrealised stock holdings as assets said Industrial Bank's Suzuki There is also concern that Japanese companies which have invested heavily in Tokyo's stocks as their real business declined over the last two years have sustained heavy losses Many companies mainly export-oriented companies were planning on selling their shares for a profit to reinvest in real businesses as the economy begins to pick up said one analyst at a foreign brokerage That prospect now looks dim But analysts said it is unlikely companies or financial institutions will be bankrupted by losses in stock trading I don't think any company is so badly exposed in stock investments said a senior analyst at Nomura Research Institute In terms of financial institutions luckily the rebounding bond market and currency markets are still profitable he added The Nomura analyst said a 10 pct decline in Tokyo stocks would be translated into a fall of about 02 pct in consumer spending Some 20 pct of Tokyo stocks are owned by individuals Market capitalisation on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell to 329588 billion yen on Tuesday from 386041 billion at Monday's close NTT shares ended 260000 yen lower at 265 mln each well down from their peak of 318 mln in April 100 mln dlr equity warrant bond for Intec Inc <INTTT> of Japan has been cancelled because of turbulent market activity following today's 149 pct plunge in Tokyo stock prices Nikko Securities Co (Europe) Ltd said as lead manager The five year issue on launched October 13 had terms fixed yesterday when it last traded at a bid only price of less 2-1/4 pct placing it on total fees Nikko officials said Indeed dealers said stock price volatility shut down trading altogether in Japanese equity related debt issues today and cast doubt on the new issue calendar for the next few weeks during which as many as eight new deals were to be launched Finance Minister Michael Wilson says the leading industrial nations have held a number of discussions on providing liquidity to the financial system after Monday's record stock market decline There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada the United States Japan Britain West Germany France and Italy) he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer interest rates have been dropping Wilson said The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries Wilson said This has been going on during the course of yesterday through the evening and this morning and this will continue he said What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economieslooks good Wilson said Irish Banks Plc <ALBKL> said it plans to open a Tokyo office Initially it will be a representative office but the company said it hopes to have a full banking licence in about two years Secretary Richard Lyng said the ruling of a GATT panel on a US trade complaint against Japan expected soon may influence the US stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a US demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the US These are quota items and the principles that apply to them it seems to me will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus Lyng told in an interview He repeated the US demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31 next year The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste some cheeses and specialty fruit juices US officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman The US has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus) If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT Lyng said He declined to say what action the US would take next April if Japan continues to resist US demands European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said Inc said it was selected to perform fact-finding security system surveys for the authority that is building Kansai International Airport in Osaka Japan The company said the 340000 dlr contract was significant because it was the first contract issued by the authority solely to an American company without Japanese partners The contract calls for TRW to perform studies of other international airport security systems on behalf of Kansai the company said Kansai is scheduled to be operational in 1993 collapse in US stock prices has hit Japanese investors hard since they had shifted to stocks from bonds earlier this year and will slow down Japanese capital flows to the US investors and stock brokers said Until recently Japanese net purchases of US stocks were projected to leap to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year from four billion dlrs in 1986 securities industry sources said The Japanese had suffered severely from US bond investments and now (they are suffering) in US stocks said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd Japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in Treasury securities until early this year which led to heavy currency losses following the dollar's steep decline Even though their US bond purchases moderated since then Japanese investors continued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply in recent months Now the historic fall in the US stock market has stunned Japanese investors killing their appetite for US stocks Keita Konishi of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co said while his firm was not panicked into an across-the-board sell-off of its US stock investments he does not expect it to resume buying stocks for some time There has been no panic selling by Japanese institutional investors so far during the stock price nosedive said Susumu Uchiyama of Yamaichi Internatinal (America) Inc Following the steep decline however Japanese are not buying even though US stocks now appear bargain-priced he said There will be no big wave of Japanese investment in the US for the time being said Keiji Tsuda of Nissei BOT Asset Management Corp an investment advisory body to Nippon Life Insurance Co It's the time to think twice The psychological impact (on investors' behaviour) will drag on considerably he said The latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered by US Treasury Secretary James Baker as he threatened a futher dollar fall in retaliation for higher West German interest rate rises and undermined foreign investors' confidence in the dollar Tsuda said The US economy is still sitting on the time bomb of huge budget and trade deficits he said and investors' worries over the twin problems have intensified Before I thought the dollar's large fall (over the past two years) would take out the detonator out of that bomb but it hasn't Tsuda said Investors and brokers said the Japanese for the first time have experienced the enormous volatality of the New York stock market often caused by program trading A stock trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc said that while Japanese investors had been attracted by American firms' superior performance relative to Japanese firms in terms of earnings per share US stocks' downside potential is now much larger than that oJapanese stocks While the Japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive it could be stabilized by the efforts of large Japanse firms A high percentage of Japanese equities are held by companies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks of other Japanese firms in order to strengthen their business ties through this cross-holding relationship analysts said Despite the massacare on the Wall Street Japanese investors are not expected to withdraw from US stocks US equities are in a process to be built in diversification of their portfolios and the portion of them is still very small Japanese investors said But it is unclear when the Japanese will resume purchasing US stocks and much depends on the dollar's stability they said Kondo of Yasuda Trust said Japanese investors are not fully convinced that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is determined to fend the dollar's value and check future inflation in the US Because of uncertainty over the dollar's direction and inflation in the US Japanese investors have not yet jumped on the Treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yield rises investors said Konishi of Sumitomo Life said A US recession is being talked about so it may be time to shift back to bonds but I feel uneasy about buying any US instruments right now Tsuda of Nissei questioned the strength of the recent rally in US government bond prices He said the steep bond market rally has no real trend as bond prices are rising on short covering and bills are rising on temporary fund shift from the stock market United States may lift an additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month Reagan Administration officials said President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the US and third country markets and to open its home market to US goods The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets hand-held power tools and portable computers Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the US market at below production costs Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to US goods US and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force the officials said until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement Reagan said the United States remains committed to the Louvre accord in which the seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency exchange rates The United States remains committed to the Louvre agreement Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers Reagan said the United States Japan and West Germany had all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic policies Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic relations with the United States Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre agreement They reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable exchange rates Reagan said Communications Co said it signed an agreement with CST Communications Co for the purpose of financing American motion picture projects CST is an American corporation formed by C Itoh and Co Ltd <CITTT> Suntory Ltd and Tokyo Broadcasting Systems Inc <TBRST> The company did not detail the agreement Bank of Japan bought around 50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds in an operation seen aimed at allaying fears of a collapse in the market bond traders said The central bank bought the 68 pct 73rd 65 pct 80th and 51 pct 89th issues Yield on the key 89th bond due 1996 subsequently fell to 5560 pct in early trading from 5920 pct at the close on Tuesday after opening at 5600 pct The market had generally welcomed the operation and trading volume had been gradually increasing There was some retail bargain-hunting for less active issues traders said Bank of Japan reassured a nervous money market after the sharp fall in Tokyo stock prices yesterday by conducting a 200 billion yen commercial bill purchase operation money traders said The central bank injected funds through three-month repurchase agreements which mature on January 11 and bear interest of 39375 pct identical to this morning's rates on three-month commercial bills The operation was done partly to roll over 300 billion yen in commercial bills maturing this morning Money market sources project a 260 billion yen surplus today In the bond market the Bank of Japan offered to buy around 50 billion yen of 10-year government bonds encouraging an already firm tone in bond prices dealers said The Bank of Japan was trying to reassure market participants that it was ready to supply funds whenever the market needed them especially after Tuesday's plunge in Tokyo stock prices securities house traders said The widely held market belief that interest rates were heading higher was a major cause of the recent tumble in bond market prices and one reason behind the stock market plunge they said market analysts polled before Tokyo's market opened on Tuesday said Wall Street's dramatic fall on Monday was overdone and although Tokyo would fall drastically at the opening it might stabilise later Factors affecting the Tokyo market are not the same as those in New York they said Tokyo's market is completely different from New York said a senior analyst at Nomura Securities We have no computer (program) selling and much more stable share ownership than in New York The discount rate in Japan cannot rise the senior Nomura analyst said He said the Tokyo Exchange's 225-share index may fall 1000 points on Tuesday because of basic concern It dropped 62018 points to 2574656 on Monday But he said a 1000 point fall would be nothing compared to New York New York overreacted the dollar is rising -- that should be a positive sign for New York he said The Tokyo Stock Exchange opens from 0900 local time (0000 GMT) to 1500 local (0600 GMT) The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points (or 225 pct) to 1738 on Monday its biggest ever one day decline in both absolute and percentage terms Simon Smithson a Kleinwort Benson International share analyst said Tokyo's market was likely to free fall in morning trading but perhaps would stabilise later He too predicted a drop of perhaps 1000 points in the index today But he said overall economic conditions in the US And Japan were different The problems that pushed down the New York market like the (US) budget deficit trade deficit and slow economic growth do not exist in Japan Smithson said However a stocks fund manager at a major trust bank made a more gloomy prediction The situation is different in the two markets but you cannot ignore New York he said Foreigners will be selling and the index funds will be selling he said A fund manager at another Japanese trust bank said Monday's New York fall was completely out of the range of expectations All we can do is wait now and see what happens There seem to be no factors which would stop the fall There is no way we can invest now he said Manhattan Corp (CMB) president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic conditions If we are right about the fundamentals this thing should settle down Labrecque said at a news conference at the American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause US monetary officials to ease credit policies Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year Labrecque said He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to continue well into 1988 I don't think the stock market will cause a recession Labrecque said He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from the stock market fall would be Chase's stock price however dropped 23 pct but other money center banks suffered even sharper losses Referring to the banking industry he said: We're talking about one day These are strong institutions he said Labrecque said he did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary policy in view of the stock market's behavior If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the other way he said Labrecque said the high US budget deficit was not the single most important factor behind the market's worries He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the United States West Germany Japan and Britain Japanese investment in US real estate will continue despite a weak dollar because such investments are strong hedges against inflation financiers and real estate industry experts said Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in US real estate Setsuya Tabuchi chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investing in Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered in the past during the dollar's sharp decline But he added Real estate is a hedge against inflation so such investment will not decline Japanese total investment in US real estate last year is estimated at around six billion dlrs exceeding the four billion dlrs ploughed into US equities Arther Mitchell of Coudert Brothers a US law firm told the conference Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanese banks and leasing companies the total aamount of Japanese funds committed to US real estate projects could reach 20 billion dlrs in 1987 he said The dollar's fall has made US property cheap and exchange risks are low because many Japanese firms are making investments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130 he said Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now looking at a wider variety of real estate investments including development projects and suburban buildings Benjamin Lambert chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc said the sale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designed to expand its customer base to Japan through the securities house's close ties with Japanese investors Participation in mortgage loans is becoming popular among Japanese panelists said Mortgages can be made to disguise active purchases and years later the loans can be converted into ownership of the property they said Control Systems Inc said it entered into a marketing agreement with a Japanese firm to distribute Cardiac's pacemakers in Japan Cardiac said the agreement requires the Japanese firm to purchase certain minimum quantities of pacemakers annually over the next three years with the aggregate value of purchases of about 12 mln dlrs Cardiac said it received an initial order from the Japanese company which is did not name for about 22 mln dlrs and expects to begin shipments during its fourth quarter to end March 31 1988 massive stock market correction on Wall Street will force a decline in Japanese share prices but a decline of similar proportions will not occur due to economic factors said Setsuya Tabuchi chairman of the board of Nomura Securities Co Ltd There are less inflation worries in Japan and less possibility of interest rate rises Tabuchi told reporters He also said Japan had a higher savings rate which provided more funds for investment than was the case in other countries If interest rates rise worldwide Japan may raise the discount rate but the possibility of a Japanese rate increase is smaller than in the US Britain and West Germany Tabuchi said However he noted that the Nikkei Dow stock index of the Tokyo stock exchange and the Dow Jones Industrial average have moved in tandem in the past four years The Dow fell 508 points to 1738 on Monday its largest percentage decline since the First World War The Tokyo index fell 62018 to 2574656 on Monday the sixth largest decline on record ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Tuesdayhose former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita to be the next prime minister replacing Yasuhiro Nakasone whose term ends on October 30 LDP officials told the choice was made by Nakasone after Takeshita and two other contenders failed in marathon closed-door meetings to agree who should be Japan's next leader They were vying for the presidency of the LDP a post which automatically carries with it the premiership by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority Louvre accord on currency stability which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil foreign exchange dealers said But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive US Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan who both have large trade surpluses pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the US While the US Agreed to stop talking the dollar down However Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative the West German interest rate move would force the US To re-examine the accord The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany  He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation Chris Johns currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view telling that the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur who hosted the Louvre meeting was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks He called for a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord In Frankfurt F Wilhelm Christians joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank said that following recent meetings with Baker he believed that the US Was still committed to the accord In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 380 pct on Monday down from the 385 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct Fine Art Corp said it completed an exclusive license agreement with the Seiyoken Group of Toyko to open Circle Galleries in Japan The first Circle Gallery is to open in Tokyo in ealry 1988 with additional Circle Galleries planned the company said The license agreement is Circle Fine Art's second expansion outside the US this year Earlier this year it formed a joint venture company in Canada Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said Japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG the sources said They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan the sources said Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions traders said They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 21 pct a year from 1986 through 1991 Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987 when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase the sources said The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 195 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987 the sources said But when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market they said Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year of which 53 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia 33 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer the sources said The Japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 1752 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January the trade sources said Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement Under the present contract Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said When we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one Motor Corp <TOYOT> and Volkswagen AG <VOWGF> are considering raising the local procurement rate at their West German joint venture to at least 60 pct from an earlier planned 50 pct after one year's output a Toyota spokesman said The two carmakers agreed last June to start jointly producing a Toyota-designed light truck at VW's Hanover plant from early 1989 at a rate of 7000 to 8000 the first year rising to 15000 from 1990 They may equip the light truck with a Volkswagen-made engine to reach a local procurement rate of 60 pct he said The two companies need to raise the value of locally procured parts to 60 pct to avoid tariffs when they export to other European markets industry sources said Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added Bank of Japan will sell 800 billion yen in bills from its holdings on Tuesday to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 470 billion yen and recycle 400 billion in bills maturing then money market traders said Of the total 400 billion yen will yield 38512 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses through 29-day repurchase agreements maturing on November 17 These are aimed at meeting a projected cash shortage on that day when the government floats 195 mln shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp The other 400 billion will yield 39006 pct through 44-day repurchase accords maturing on December 2 The operation will bring the supply of bills outstanding to about 3200 billion yen clear indication has emerged of the victor in the race to succeed Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone but political analysts said it was becoming more likely that former foreign minister Shintaro Abe would be chosen A decision on which of the three contenders would be picked was expected late today or early on Tuesday they said Japanese political leaders held a flurry of closed-door meetings today and the three candidates called on Nakasone who is due to step down late this month to mediate to break the deadlock The other candidates are Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and former Finance Minister Noboru Takeshita They are vying for the post of president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who is automatically prime minister by virtue of the party's parliamentary majority The new LDP president will be named formally at a party convention on October 30 and elected prime minister by parliament probably on November 6 LDP sources said Nakasone 69 is due to retire on October 31 after five years in the post an exceptionally long term by Japanese standards Takeshita who is head of the party's largest faction had steadfastly opposed the idea of seeking Nakasone's help but he told reporters: It is possible Nakasone will be given carte blanche (for selection of his successor) One political analyst who declined to be identified said Nakasone despite a personal preference for Miyazawa is likely to choose Abe as the best candidate for steering Japan through its international problems and maintaining party unity Abe also would also accept Nakasone's influence he said Analysts said one of Nakasone's prime aims is to retain as much power as possible following his retirement Takeshita the early favorite because of the size of his faction is viewed by many politicians and analysts as being unsuitable for the post of prime minister because of his lack of international experience The analysts said Nakasone also was very unlikely to support Takeshita's bid because of the differences in their political styles Corp <TDKT> said its sales

Shinpan reached a similar agreement with <Visa International> on September 29 Ministry of Finance has started to consider the coupon rate of the 10-year government bond issue for November a Ministry official said The underwriting syndicate may want a rise in the coupon rate by nearly one point from the current 49 pct he said But bond traders see a rise to about 56 pct as most likely Ministry officials will try to keep the rate low to meet US Requests for maintenance of the interest rate differential between the US And Japan the Ministry official told Plans for an October issue were cancelled when the Ministry and the bond underwriting syndicate failed to reach agreement on terms The underwriting syndicate will start negotiating with the Finance Ministry on the terms of the November issue after any changes in the prime rate for November are decided which should be by the end of this week an underwriting source said Cancellation of the November bond issue is not out of the question he said adding that negotiations are expected to be difficult foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the US Dollar will drop below the significant 14000 yen level dealers said The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range If the currency breaks through this level it may decline sharply said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division The dollar was at 14110 yen at midday against Friday closes of 14235/45 in New York and 14135 here The dollar opened at 14095 yen and fell to a low of 14040 It was 17733/38 marks against 17975/85 in New York and 18008/13 here on Friday after an opening 17700/10 The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by US Treasury Secretary James Baker dealers said The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker's comments said Dai-ichi's Tanaka He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in US Bond prices dealers said Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge US Trade deficit Tanaka said US August trade data showed the US Deficit at a still massive 1568 billion dlrs But if West Germany raises interest rates this would run counter to the pledge he said Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention said Soichi Hirabayashi deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange department The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 14000 to 16000 yen dealers said The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively Hirabayashi said He said the US Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum three pct from 45 pct on October 25 It

tension in the Gulf 
kenya,Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996 A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000 The PTA set up in 1982 groups Burnudi the Comoros Djibouti Ethiopia Kenya Lesotho Malawi Mauritius Rwanda Somalia Swaziland Tanzania Uganda Zambia and Zimbabwe PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added service payments on Kenya's three billion dlr external debt will absorb nearly all the 11 billion dlrs of foreign aid likely over the next four years President Daniel arap Moi said While we expect to receive 183 billion Kenyan shillings in the form of external loans for our development programs in the next four years we will be repaying more than 135 billion By way of external debt servicing Moi told a conference of American businessmen in Nairobi The president added that if developing countries continue to experience foreign exchange outflows on this scale many will be unable to sustain a level of imports necessary to ensure economic growth He called on the international community to ensure a real transfer of resources from the industrialised to the developing countries Moi said Kenya had so far met all obligations regarding its foreign debt which his government has never tried to reschedule 
kuwait,US crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said United States said Kuwait was discussing plans to lease privately-owned US tankers to transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of its own vessels under American flags State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley who made the disclosure about the tankers also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering US flag vessels with the Maritime Administration Oakley said She emphasized however that if some charter arrangement could be worked out it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis In both cases the ships would be eligible for US Navy escort in the Gulf she said The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan administrator of the Martime Administration as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company whose identify he did not know that chartered vessels flying the US flag would be protected the newspaper reported Concerning Saudi Arabia Oakley said we are moving forward in our talks  on how we can tailor our efforts and security cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said output for the second half of 1987 including that of Iraq will be above the official 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah said Iraq refused to sign the pact by which OPEC maintained its ceiling at 166 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters of 1987 In December OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter level of 183 mln bpd now cut back to the third quarter target Ali told a news conference that including Iraq OPEC third quarter output will be between 175 and 177 mln bpd while fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production levels would have on prices Iraq has an official first half quota of 1466 mln bpd rising to 154 mln in the second half but has refused to adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln barrels per day exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when a 500000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about September Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War enemy Iran which has a quota of 2255 mln bpd rising to 2369 mln in the second half Ali said the position of the 400000 bpd production from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which has been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude was fixed We will not discuss it There will not be any change he said Ali said the conference which began Thursday and ended Saturday evening had been too short for all necessary problems to be adressed We are overdoing it in holding too short a meeting We sweep a lot under the carpet he said Ali said the problem of price differentials between the prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly at the meeting Ali said The problem of differentials is a real one I would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem has not been dealt with properly Light crudes are overpriced relative to heavy crudes Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9 Ali said If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue I will not do the work of another minister Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1 with a spread of 265 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes moves to increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran diplomats said They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington As Iran knows very well what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage said one western diplomat Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on soft targets such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf The risk of Iranian attack on US Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the US Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low However There is the threat that the Iranians seeing these heavily protected US-flag tankers will go for softer targets one diplomat said Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us The US is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz The build-up ties in with US plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which the US says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz The Missouri with its four-escort flotilla is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles diplomats said A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula within range of Kuwait But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation likely moving world opinion against Iran remarked one Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf Rafsanjani who is also parliamentary leader predicted last Friday a river of blood throughout the world in the event of any US strike against Iran Western diplomats said Iran which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the US itself Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran they added United States warned Iran again that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military action in the Gulf as US warships began escorting another tanker convoy southward from Kuwait US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the US sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig Several hours later the Pentagon announced that US warships had begun escorting two US flag Kuwaiti tankers -- the 80000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46000 ton liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of US flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT under the escort by the US guided missile frigate Ford It did not say what oth US warships were in the area It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the central Gulf the Pentagon statement said Asked on NBC's Today program if the United States was prepared for a major war with Iran Weinberger said Well we are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from this situation but we don't look on it as a war Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his country's close and closed-mouthed cooperation with Washington in the Gulf a senior US official said The Saudis are being very cooperative It would be nice if the Saudis would go more public but it's their real estate said the official who asked not to be named He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were providing saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has stationed forces to protect shipping lanes The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after US naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the US flag Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack the prince who is here on an official visit replied I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower The senior US official said his remark was an endorsement of the US attack shells from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq fell on Kuwait's northern border on Tuesday but caused no casualties the Kuwait News Agency KUNA said quoting a Defense Ministry official There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in retaliation for US Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf on Monday Several shells fell in a random manner on the northern border of the country the official told KUNA It seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran and Iraq No one was wounded and there were no losses Diplomats said shells from the nearby Iran-Iraq warfront had in the past fallen in the northern Kuwaiti desert A senior Kuwait Petroleum Corporation official had earlier told he was unaware of any attack against Kuwaiti oil installations experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following US destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a US-flagged tanker The experts told Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors blockading its shipping or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues said Fred Axelgard a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) It's like a Greek tragedy said retired Adm Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area where the Navy began escorting US-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran which President Reagan could never accept US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd Young Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said We consider this matter closed he said Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the US reaction was measured reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed It had not taken this view after earlier clashes supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the US Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday analysts said December loading rose to 1965 dlrs up 45 cents before falling to around 1905/15 later unchanged from last Friday Fundamentals are awful said Philip Lambert analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 185 mln bpd little changed from September levels Peter Nicol analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank said OPEC production could be about 185-190 mln in October and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 185 mln bpd The US Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the US Flag the Sea Isle City It was struck by a missile believed to be Iranian in Kuwaiti waters and was the first hit on a US Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war The US Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday also believed struck by an Iranian missile Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the US Attack analysts said They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz through which around eight mln bpd passes isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the US Or Iran they said Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities analysts said But they saw the US Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks with some describing it as responsible Geoffrey Pyne analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew said he was impressed by the sensible US Response The US Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response Today's action by the US Was not escalatory Pyne said Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the US Strike was a responsible retaliation with the US Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view however He said he was unable to see what the US Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia whose interests the US Is supposedly defending will feel less secure as a result of the US Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a US Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula close to Kuwait analysts said The later downtrend followed confirmation of a US Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact and finding it less serious than first thought took profits taking prices lower analysts and traders said said several people were injured in Monday's US Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed retaliation Tehran radio reported It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying We will definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move unanswered A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of Qatar were injured when US Warships bombarded them this afternoon It described damage as severe Washington said four American frigates shelled and destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's missile attack on a US-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters The US Said Iranians used the platforms for military pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs earlier this month Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or personnel and said the US Attack lacked miltary value With this move Mr Reagan has committed a big mistake and has definitely increased his problems Energy Secretary John Herrington arrived in Rabat on Monday after a tour of the Gulf and the Middle East Herrington who is scheduled to meet King Hassan during his 24-hour official visit said on arrival he would discuss regional and international issues with Moroccan leaders Morocco is the last stop of a tour that has taken Herrington to Iraq Kuwait Qatar Bahrain Saudi Arabia and Egypt oil exports have not been affected by the seven-year Iran-Iraq war Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) Chairman and Managing Director Abdul Fattah al-Bader told a Kuwaiti newspaper Kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to continue exporting its oil without any reduction the Al-Anbaa newspaper quoted him as saying He said KOTC made profits of more than two mln dinars (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last June but predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for chartering and operating vessels 
lebanon,Lebanese bank employees went on a one-day strike to draw attention to the fate of three Central Bank colleagues missing believed kidnapped since 1985 The strike which shut the foreign exchange market and banks across the country was called by the Central Bank Employees' Union and the Bankers' Association which groups more than 80 Lebanese banks The three missing Christian employees are believed to have been kidnapped while crossing from Christian East Beirut to Moslem West Beirut nearly two years ago Bankers Association said it extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's collapse The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the dollar and other currencies on Monday The pound closed on Thursday at 40700/41200 to the dollar compared with Wednesday's close of 38400/38600 Association sources told Friday's suspension of trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound The Association which comprises 106 commercial banks in east and west Beirut halted trading on Friday in a chaotic market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week The pound hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil war has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this year

libya,US crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said 
luxembourg,The European Investment Bank (EIB) said it has lent 200 mln French francs to French railways Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer (SNCF) to extend its high speed train system It said in a statement that the loan will help finance the contruction of a 279 km track for high speed TGV trains between Paris and Le Mans in western France and Tours in the south west The loan will also help pay for new trains The EIB has already lent a total of 600 mln francs to SNCF for the high speed train system in 1985 and 1986 European Community's annual inflation rate fell marginally to 32 pct in May from 33 pct in April the EC's statistics office Eurostat said Prices in the 12-nation bloc rose 02 pct in May after 06 pct in April But the annual rate stayed below that of the US For the second month in succession following the release of figures showing US Inflation of 38 pct in both April and May However Eurostat said the EC was still beaten by Japan where prices were provisionally 01 pct lower in May than a year earlier Community (EC) ministers backed a commission plan for the reform of world farm trade which is due to be presented to GATT later this month EC diplomats said The plan has been drawn up by the EC executive Commission in response to US Calls in GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) for an end to all farm subsidies within the next 10 years EC foreign ministers agreed that despite reservations by some member states the plan should be presented to the next meeting of the GATT farm negotiating group in Geneva on October 26 diplomats said European Community's farmers' pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax which has already been proposed by the EC Commission Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism for cereal substitutes He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the Danish foreign and agriculture ministers who currently chair meetings of their EC colleagues Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability for producers This would in turn help the market position for certain crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds peas and beans but for which the Commission is now proposing severe output restrictions A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC price fixing However the EC Commission has said it maintains its proposals for a tax Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of bridging the gap between EC and world prices European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said farm minister Carlos Romero speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers called for action to help the Spanish maize market Spanish diplomatic sources said Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year they said They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the meeting Community (EC) agriculture ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday Danish minister Laurits Tornaes told journalists Acceptance of the scheme by which farmers would suffer price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms known in EC jargon as stabilisers is seen by diplomats as vital if the EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day meeting of farm ministers Tornaes said: It is no longer a question of whether we are to have stabilisers It is now a question of how we are to implement them However EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6 This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked to agree a new system of EC financing ending the bloc's hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable to agree a budget for 1988 Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit Under the most important stabiliser scheme EC guaranteed prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln tonnes a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of producing in a year of favourable weather conditions Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to hammer out an accord and Danish diplomatic sources said the meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation But Tornaes said any thought that success was not ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this stage EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems were appeals from Southern member states for protection for their small and relatively poor farmers and calls from France and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission proposals for arable crops They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states Meanwhile the ministers made little progress in agreeing a scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct payments which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers on them British minister John MacGregor told journalists :The proposals as they stand have very few friends He said a number of countries fear they could simply encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the cash to improve production methods foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary resources British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting in December We require numbers as well as words in all the commodity regimes Howe was quoted as saying The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for budgetary stabilisers under which there would be reductions in guaranteed prices restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities exceeded certain levels Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea although several other EC states back it in outline Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on the issue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from which it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the system by which it is financed The sources quoted Howe as saying: An interim or partial solution covering some elements of the Commission package would be unacceptable to the United Kingdom They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same marketing year as the overproduction rather than resulting in a price adjustment the following year Howe also said there should be no question of a special fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the dollar The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with emergency situations French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists that his country could not accept the idea that there should be no emergency reserve The British position has become tougher he said Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers which discussed the future of EC finances and which took place simultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider the Commission's farm spending proposals Before his meeting got under way British agriculture minister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposal to set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes agriculture ministers attacked plans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that cereals output is above standard norms EC sources said They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing spending on the cereals regime The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices or raise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest rises above 155 mln tonnes The sources said several ministers complained that changing price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage the financial security of farmers But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security regardless of market circumstances The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need for some output ceilings However the French and Dutch ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of cereal crops rather than for cereals alone The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings for individual countries with excess production being paid for from national exchequers but received no support for this idea British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he detected more support for his position against the penalties on farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility levies He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for farmers could help in this direction Community Commission President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in today's trading on world money and stock markets He told a press conference here: G-7 should meet discreetly and quickly Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the mark to levels around 160 the European Monetary System would undergo a test by fire Delors said the current problems in the markets had been caused by excessive growth in financial trading excessive deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing circumstances He said it was profoundly unjust to blame it on recent increases in West Germany European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year an EC commission spokesman said He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on US Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones the spokesman said Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming US Manufacturers It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France Britain West Germany and Spain the countries involved in the Airbus project Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf crisis The United States is fully entitled to take military action in exercise of rights of self-defense in the face of the imminent threat of further attacks Howe said in a statement issued in London The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a US- flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday Referring to that attack Howe added I trust the Iranians will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of European Community (EC) ministers Howe was asked about statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was now involved in a full-scale war It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified for Iran to react in that way he said European Community (EC) will not issue a joint statement on the US Attack on Iran for now diplomats said They said the latest events in the Gulf were discussed only briefly by foreign ministers over lunch though member states had been informed by Washington that it was planning military action They didn't have enough information to discuss it fully and they wouldn't have agreed anyway one diplomat said Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans said Belgium had always opposed an extension of violence in the Gulf and deeply regretted that the situation had deteriorated But British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said the United States was fully entitled to take military action and Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain said the US Strike could be considered an af self-defence thriving market in Luxembourg franc bond issues has been temporarily stalled by the

Martens' coalition and asked him to try to form a new government Because of the crisis Banque Generale du Luxembourg SA (BGL) has delayed a public issue for one billion Luxembourg francs originally scheduled for the end of last week BGL director Robert Sharfe said He said the issue would probably go ahead later this week It is likely there will be an upward adjustment in interest rates on

increasingly popular particularly with Scandivanian borrowers because they carry a relatively low interest rate Private investors also have flocked to buy Luxembourg franc bond issues because the

malaysia,US Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the US For growth Given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth is to urge fellow tin producing countries to contribute more money towards research into new uses for the metal Malaysian primary industries minister Lim Keng Yaik told in an interview Lim in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America said he had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries ATPC to draw up a paper on the matter Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated he feared the Commission would revive the idea Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports Since most of our products are commodity based I cannot see how this would work out in our case Lim said Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium paper and plastics Lim said He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement INRA although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited Lim who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's behalf when he visits New York during his current tour said it was important there should not be a long interregnum between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates national oil company Petronas has advised the government to raise crude oil output to 540000 barrels a day (bpd) in 1988 from a current 500000 bpd a senior company official said We have the capacity to produce the amount Rastam Hadi Petronas's Vice-President for Upstream Sector said The government will announce its decision on Friday when it unveils the country's budget Malaysia raised output this month to current levels from 420000 bpd after reviewing the world oil market In May Malaysia cut output to 420000 bpd from 459000 in response to a call by OPEC to boost prices Council meeting of the International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) has been adjourned until Thursday as tomorrow is a Malaysian national holiday officials of the organisation said The main issue at the talks which opened here yesterday has been the INRO buffer stock and the manner in which the buffer stock manager should continue to sell rubber after the current international pact for the commodity expires on October 22 they said The deadline for the start of the new pact is January 1989 Buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period Other issues discussed include ratification of the new accord the officials said Only Malaysia of the pact's 32 producing and consuming member countries had ratified the new agreement by the beginning of this month The meeting is due to end on Thursday Minister for Trade Negotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on reducing the large subsidies which the European Community and United States grant their farmers Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform the EC Common Agricultural Policy and US Plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction I am hopefully optimistic There is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the USA the EC and the Cairns Group he told reporters Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks on farm subsidies The group which includes Australia and Malaysia advocates free farm trade and says US European and Japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in North and South America the EC and Thailand and leaves for Indonesia on Wednesday proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the US Senate The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote virtually snuffing out US soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year A similar proposal has made no headway in the House Sen Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package I don't see this as a trade issue I see it as giving American consumers the information they need he said Proponents of the measure including the American Soybean Association have claimed palm palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease The US soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils imported primarily from Malaysia Indonesia and the Philippines But Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind) read a letter from US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter who said the proposal blatantly discriminates against imports would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils The committee voted largely along party lines with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure police denied rumours of race riots in Kuala Lumpur after an armed man killed one person and injured two others in an attack on two petrol stations in a racially-sensitive area of the city A police statement broadcast over official Radio Malaysia called on the public not to listen to the rumours and go about their normal business Everything is under control It's only a small matter and there is no cause for alarm a police spokesman told after confirming the shooting on Sunday night However rumours that riots had broken out hit the stock market and shares on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange fell across the board in heavy nervous selling when the market opened this morning brokers said Police said they cordoned off the district of Chow Kit and set up road blocks from midnight after the man armed with a rifle killed one Malay and injured another Malay and a Chinese He set fire to one of the petrol stations recovery from the worst recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988 after seven years of austerity economists said Our country is walking on one leg now said Ismail Salleh an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985 The fiscal year ends December 31 The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber palm oil tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa timber and oil The government slashed development spending to 98 billion ringgit this year from 145 billion in 1986 Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct in 1988 against about 95 pct this year Local investment also has stagnated with businessmen blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives One businessman said too many politicians give the impression that Malaysia was unstable If we can take care of investment confidence the potential to recover strongly is great a banker said Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year's 12 billion ringgit deficit The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989 The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit The government will also repay some of its external debt which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986 Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax now between 45 and 48 pct to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states Rubber Organisation (INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable but acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well from a condition and quality standpointRubber stored in proper conditions does not deteriorate he told in a telephone interview The quality of buffer stock rubber sold since he entered the market in September would be discussed at an INRO Council meeting which opened here today he said Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible poor quality Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month INRO's five-day moving average was quoted at 2373 cents on October 16 He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock was uppermost in consumers' minds We have received good interest for the rubber I understand the Japanese concern Many consumers want to try the rubber before they carry on buying he said Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different locations in producing and consuming nations adding all warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the past week to 10 days and this could reflect a wait and see attitude by buyers he said Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts until they test out the rubber If their tests are positiive they are likely to buy more Hofmeister said he could reduce the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates that he had sold around 30000 to 32000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur and New York since September But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an idea of the quantity he had sold noting that traders overall had put buffer stock sales at between 25000 and 35000 tonnes The question of sales from the original 360000 tonne buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday The current international rubber pact expires on October 22 The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during the interim period

saying it would curb their exports slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt Mario Rodriguez Montero president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto Rodriguez said as yet the administration is not in a veto frame of mind officials from

net national income (NNI) despite excess spending by the central government according to a leaked official report The so-called Spring Report giving latest revenue and expenditure figures and to be discussed by the Dutch cabinet today was leaked in advance to the Dutch press The Dutch Finance Ministry declined to comment on the press reports Newspapers quoted the report drafted by Finance Minister Onno Ruding as saying unexpected rises in revenue would compensate for excess spending of 31 billion guilders Ruding putting this year's public sector borrowing requirement 01 percentage point below last September's target at 78 pct criticised the excess spending but will not seek additional spending cuts for 1987 because of the surprise boost in revenue the report was quoted as saying Excess spending by the central government was put at 28 billion guilders while market factors accounted for another 300 mln in unbudgetted expenditure But 1987 revenue was boosted by an unexpected 355 billion including 19 billion in tax revenue and 500 mln guilders in income from natural gas sales Ruding has said the 1987 excess spending will burden the 1988 budget with an additional 19 billion and the cabinet has already pledged 12 billion in cuts to narrow the gap The cabinet is to discuss in coming months what further austerity measures will be needed next year to keep the government on target for its 1990 aim of a public sector borrowing requirement of no more than 525 pct of NNI Ruding has already met opposition from the Liberal and Christian-Democrat factions

continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added may bring the dutch government before the world court of justice in the hague to press for a resumption of a 100 mln dlr aid program cut off in 1982 prime minister jules wijdenbosch said Wijdenbosch told a news conference tuesday his government may request the court to make a judgment on the aid suspended after the december 1982 murders of 15 surinamese opposition leaders while they were in government custody manager Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN) said it has completed the formation of a syndicate for Dutch

Banque Bruxelles Lambert Bank Mees & Hope Banque Nationale de Paris Deutsche Bank Capital Markets Dresdner Bank EBC Amro Kredietbank NV Van Lanschot Bankiers Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank Pierson Heldring en Pierson Rabobank Vereins & Westbank and SG Warburg Securities Treasury Department said it notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948 income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba The termination is effective January 1 1988 the Treasury said in a two-sentence announcement The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands over the past eight years had failed to reach an accord a Treasury spokesman said The decision means the sale by US parent companies of Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no longer be free of the 30 pct US withholding tax the spokesman said Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early Most have maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984 the spokesman said He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an adverse effect on US issuers of the bonds because the general decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance at lower interest rates However the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced with lower yields US decision ending a forty-year tax treaty covering the Netherlands Antilles was unlikely to have a major impact on the Eurobond market tax experts said Most US firms stopped using financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell to the Eurobond market in July 1984 the experts said But the decision affects Eurobonds issued before July 1984 involving principal worth an estimated 30 billion dlrs and will probably mean those bonds will be called before their maturity date they said Since most of the bonds are currently trading at a premium calling them in early will mean a loss in market value for the bondholders according to a Treasury official who asked not to be identified The official said the Treasury Department was currently unsure about the impact of the move on the Eurobond market We are monitoring the situation and receiving reports from investors and issuers the official said Earlier the Treasury said it notified the Netherlands of the termination of the treaty effective January 1 1988 For years US firms seeking to avoid a 30 pct withholding tax used financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds which are bonds issued abroad by an overseas financial subsidiary But most companies have since taken advantage of a 1984 change in the law known as the exemption for portfolio interest that allows them to sell directly in the Eurobond market and avoid the withholding tax The 1984 tax change sharply reduced the number of US companies using the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds said Steven Hannes of accounting firm Touche Ross and Co Ending the tax treaty will mean that some foreigners investing in the US through the Netherlands Antilles will lose tax benefits and probably change their portfolios Hannes said He said the decision would mainly affect foreign investors who sought tax advantages because they reside in countries which do not have a tax treaty with the United States These investors typically reside in countries in the Middle East Central and South America he said Some of them may withdraw their US investments or seek tax relief through the Netherlands itself or Switzerland but the choices are limited Hannes said It is conceivable their investment may stay here They would bear some of the tax that has not been borne in the past Hannes said US domestic bonds are not affected by the change US companies with Eurobonds issued through the Netherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoid the tax liability a Treasury Department spokesman said But they could refinance at lower rates because of the general decline in interest rates so the Department does not expect US firms to be hurt by the decision the spokesman said Negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands continued without success since the late 1970's The differences centered on US concern over residents of third countries avoiding US taxes by using the treaty with the Netherlands Antilles cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates Community (EC) agriculture ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday Danish minister Laurits Tornaes told journalists Acceptance of the scheme by which farmers would suffer price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms known in EC jargon as stabilisers is seen by diplomats as vital if the EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day meeting of farm ministers Tornaes said: It is no longer a question of whether we are to have stabilisers It is now a question of how we are to implement them However EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6 This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked to agree a new system of EC financing ending the bloc's hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable to agree a budget for 1988 Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit Under the most important stabiliser scheme EC guaranteed prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln tonnes a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of producing in a year of favourable weather conditions Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to hammer out an accord and Danish diplomatic sources said the meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation But Tornaes said any thought that success was not ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this stage EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems were appeals from Southern member states for protection for their small and relatively poor farmers and calls from France and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission proposals for arable crops They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states Meanwhile the ministers made little progress in agreeing a scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct payments which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers on them British minister John MacGregor told journalists :The proposals as they stand have very few friends He said a number of countries fear they could simply encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the cash to improve production methods 
new-zealand,New Zealand's opposition National Party said it would cut personal and business taxes and would not regulate or control interest rates if returned to power The economic strategy was unveiled by party leader Jim Bolger one day before prime minister David Lange announces the date of general elections widely expected to be August 15 The National Party's tax policies included the abolition of death and gift duties and the removal of indirect taxes on basic food and doctors' fees The most recent opinion poll taken on June 20 gave Labour a 26 point lead over National or eight points more than a month earlier National said that under its administration the New Zealand dollar would find its level with complementary fiscal and monetary policies The party did not elaborate Controversy over National's economic policy erupted in March when former prime minister Robert Muldoon said the party had adopted a policy of a managed exchange rate Bolger said then that the National Party would continue to float the dollar Since the dollar was floated by the Labour Party in March 1985 it has risen about 34 pct cutting the export incomes of farmers who are traditional National Party supporters The party said tight monetary policies alone would lead to unrealistic exchange rates which would be out of line for exporters unless they were supported by a low government borrowing requirement a shrinking government sector and positive growth It aimed to keep aspects of deregulation which have benefitted New Zealanders while cutting government spending unemployment interest rates inflation and tax The National Party intends to privatise totally the <Bank of New Zealand> <Development Finance Corporation> <Tourist Hotel Corporation> <Petrocorp> <State Insurance> and <Government Life Office> the party said Other candidates for privatisation such as <Air New Zealand Ltd> would be considered when the share market could absorb them Equity (Pacific) Ltd> (IEP) the

Bank of New Zealand said there was no evidence to suggest the fall in share prices had affected financial stability and it would maintain its firm monetary policy Governor Spencer Russell said in a statement the central bank did not accept arguments that the battle against inflation should now take a low second priority after the sharemarket's plunge Russell said the bank had two statutory responsibilities -- to implement the government's monetary policy to bring down inflation and to ensure the financial sector's stability Unless the bank is directed otherwise the firm monetary policy will continue because it is very much in the national interest that it do so he said And there is yet no evidence available to the bank to suggest that the fall in share prices has affected the stability of the financial sector The Barclays share index fell a record 50475 points to 292526 on Tuesday a decline of 147 pct Minister Roger Douglas said the fall in share prices on local and world markets demonstrated that New Zealand could not be isolated from global trends We can't expect to isolate ourselves from developments around the world Douglas told reporters I think above all what today's problems illustrate is that the sort of policies that we have been putting in place the last three years are absolutely essential so that New Zealand's economic performance improves relative to the rest of the world The New Zealand share market fell 147 pct on Tuesday in a record one-day fall Douglas told a news conference at which the government announced plans to sell its 89 pct stake in <New Zealand Steel Ltd> that the sharemarket fall would not affect plans to sell parts of state-owned corporations such as <Air New Zealand> <DFC New Zealand Ltd> and <Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd> Asked if the government considered acting to close the sharemarket for a period Douglas said: No I'm not sure it would have been my job to do so Challenge Ltd <FLTCWE> (FCL) announced a striking price of 589 NZ Dlrs a share for shareholders who have elected to receive bonus shares under its dividend reinvestment plan It said in a statement the price was determined by taking 90 pct of the weighted average prices of ordinary shares sold on the New Zealand Stock Exchange between October 12 and 19 FCL shares were quoted from Monday as ex-dividend and closed at 610 dlrs income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the NZ Dollar independent economist Len Bayliss said Bayliss a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies The taxes would help cut the budget deficit which in turn would lower the value of the NZ Dollar he said in a speech He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government's 13 billion dlr forecast Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product a major tax increase was probably unavoidable Bayliss said He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax introduced in October 1986 but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency he added New Zealand's inflation rate was 169 pct in the year to end-September against 189 pct in the year to end June The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit Bayliss said The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government's macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful Bayliss said Zealand has imposed sanctions against Fiji in response to that country's change of status to a republic acting prime minister Geoffrey Palmer said The sanctions will end all military cooperation and cut economic aid New Zealand will also not renew an agreement which supports the price of Fijian sugar when it expires in March The loss of aid and sugar supports will cost Fiji about 10 mln dlrs a year Palmer told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the government had asked High Commissioner Rod Gates to return from Suva for discussions about other possible measures We won't be reacting further until these discussions with the High Commissioner and the Prime Minister have been held Palmer said The sanctions were approved by the cabinet soon after Colonel Sitivene Rabuka staged his second coup on September 25 Implementation was postponed in the hope that Rabuka might turn back from declaring a republic Palmer said the cabinet was happy with the statement from Commonwealth leaders in

nicaragua,European coffee roasters and traders have agreed to propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee Organization ICO quotas Dutch Coffee Trade Association chairman chairman Frits van Horick said Van Horick who is a council member of the European Coffee Federation was speaking at the end of the ECF annual meeting The new formula is based on six-year moving averages and would give Brazil the world's biggest coffee producer an unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current coffee agreement van Horick said If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the ICO the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new agreement van Horick said Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in Brazil Although prices are now considerably lower consumers and producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the formula because it feared a lower quota But our proposal leaves it very little to object to van Horick said The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not reflect supply and demand reality he said Our formula builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost everyone Although full implications of the new formula have still to be worked out initial estimates suggest countries such as Colombia Kenya Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly higher quotas while others such as the Ivory Coast El Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share van Horick said Because the proposal provides that future quota distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply it should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the September meeting most of whom are generally in favour of a new quota formula  van Horick said At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side If there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two months and most other producers favour our proposal we might just get an agreement van Horick added foreign minister ali akbar velayati here on a two-day official visit informed cuban foreign ministry officials on monday on the tense situation in the gulf diplomatic sources said They said the envoy's trip to be followed from tuesday by a visit to nicaragua could be linked to a possible mediation of the non-aligned movement in the seven-year-old iran-iraq war but they ruled out any prominent cuban role in it Velayati could not be reached for comment on the US Attack on an abandoned iranian oil rig on monday which tehran vowed to avenge

nigeria,OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm Lukman who is also Nigerian oil minister told reporters here ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference which starts June 25 We already have an agreement which may need only a slight review Lukman said The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at 158 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to just above the official OPEC levels with oil industry analysts firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement to keep the market stable I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to strengthen the gains we have made so far Lukman said He declined to say if the current ceiling should be maintained or raised to 166 mln bpd for the third quarter and 183 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our collective will to keep the market strong he said He said non-OPEC member Norway which he visited two weeks ago had pledged further cooperation with the group and this was significant for its members Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a restocking now for the winter was responsible for current market strength target date of mid-September has been set for the signing of a package rescheduling Nigeria's medium term public sector debt and outstanding letter of credit claims Nigeria and Barclays Bank Plc said in a joint statement The statement was issued during the last of a two day meeting here between the two sides Barclays is a co-chairman of the commercial bank steering committee The statement said Further progress has been made in the 1986/87 rescheduling of medium term public sector debt and outstanding letter of credit claims military rulers will transfer power to an elected civilian government in 1992 two years later than previously planned at the conclusion of a gradual handover starting this year official sources said The Armed Forces Ruling Council has approved the main details of the transition which will probably be announced this week by the President General Ibrahim Babangida Among other important decisions the council has also chosen to limit the number of political parties under civilian rule to two the sources added 
norway,The Norwegian company <Konsgberg Vaapenfabrikk> (KV) may have sold more high technology defence equipment since an original deal in 1982 senior justice officials said State prosecutor Tor-Aksel Busch told he had started fresh investigations into the state-owned arms firm which delivered computers to the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1983 used to make near-silent submarine propellers There may have been other deliveries of the same equipment since then he said central bank reserves totalled 7371 billion crowns in May against 7606 billion in April and 9502 billion in May 1986 the Central Bank said in its monthly report Foreign exchange reserves totalled 703 billion crowns compared with 684 billion in April and 880 billion a year ago Gold reserves were unchanged from April's 2848 mln

pct cutback in planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15 until the end of this year Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle told We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna he said The accord reached there means stability in the oil market and we shall continue making our contribution The cuts originally brought in from February 1 would probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament Helle said The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 158 mln bpd and it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter ceiling of 166 mln bpd rising to 183 mln in the fourth quarter Norway which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore fields previously said it would continue its output curbs from planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained within its December accord on output and prices Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around 840000 bpd in 1986 Since then it has risen to around one mln bpd and is expected to reach about 15 mln bpd by 1995 The 75 pct cut from planned production implemented since February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80000 bpd Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien currently in Iceland for a meeting of Nordic ministers has made no official statement on the latest oil production cutbacks Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC producers including the Soviet Union Mexico China Malaysia and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep prices stable Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around 18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price during the first half of 1986 But firmer oil prices since then have brought some stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade deficit Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to the producing oil companies to set the levels of production central bank sold crowns in the open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the currency which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket of currencies dealers said The central bank declined comment but dealers noted the bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on Friday The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies They've been in again this morning selling piecemeal whenever they think necessary a senior dealer at an Oslo bank who declined to be identified told The crown's index is currently around 10960 in the basket -- close to its upper limit of 10950 which the central bank is committed to defending A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 11450 The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest rates currently around 16 pct in the money market and better than

resumed production at fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field rescue project Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's voluntary move to curb by 75 pct planned

restraints enforced since February 1 1987 on all its North Sea fields for the rest of the year Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field which pumped 168023 bpd in September against 48195 bpd in August field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields which use the Ekofisk pipeline were shut down for most of August while Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd operator of the Ula field said September output rose to 86727 bpd after dropping to 27237 bpd in August because of the shutdown Valhall operated by Amoco Norway A/S flowed 74694 bpd last month compared with 69748 bpd in August the company said September production was also sharply higher at the Statfjord field Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord which extends into the British North Sea sector was 611138 bpd against 552646 bpd in August operator Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said Norway's 222 pct share of the Murchison field which like Statfjord extends into the British sector yielded 15388 bpd in September a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous month Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109670 bpd in September compared with 100188 in August Norsk Hydro operator of the Oseberg field said test output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl totalled 1719 bpd last month down sharply from 16170 bpd in August Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on stream a second well cutting September production to just two days Rogaland a large Norwegian savings bank has in place a

communication products Norske Creditbank (DNC) <NCBOOL> Norway's biggest commercial bank said it boosted its profits in 1987's first eight months by 323 pct after vigorously cutting loan losses and operating costs The bank showed a 300 mln crown net profit after provisions for losses and taxes in the period ending on August 31 against a 203 mln crown profit in the same year-ago period it said DNC's biggest gains were seen in the domestic market but some of its foreign exchange and securities units have been hit by sharply higher interest rates for the dollar and results remained unsatisfactory it added Total assets rose to 132 billion crowns from 1076 billion Although the group's operating profit dropped to 875 mln crowns compared with 986 mln a year-ago the loss was countered by reducing the need to set aside capital to cover loan losses it added In 1986 DNC made substantial provisions for potential loan losses particularly in the oil and shipping sectorsThe need for write-offs in these sectors has now been substantially reduced the bank said DNC with extensive exposure in the oil industry was hard hit by plunging crude prices last year state oil company Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap (Statoil) signed contracts worth a total of 15 billion Norwegian crowns in connection with the development of the Veslefrikk oil field Statoil said Moss Rosenberg Verft of Stavanger has been awarded a contract to convert the the drilling platform West Vision to a floating production platform The work is to be completed in the summer of 1989 Aker Verdal has been awarded a contract for the engineering purchasing and construction of the steel jacket for the wellhead platform also to be completed in 1989 Statoil said current account showed a 99 billion crown deficit for the first seven months of 1987 against a 197 billion crown deficit for the same year-ago period the Central Bureau of Statistics said North Sea oil and gas revenues rose 34 pct to 326 billion crowns

field development contracts totalling 15 billion crowns with two domestic yards the company said in a statement Moss Rosenberg Verft a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier A/S <KVIOOL> won a 12 billion crown contract to convert Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating production platform and to build the deck for a separate fixed well-head platform to be placed on the field it said Statoil said Aker Verdal a unit of Aker Norcem A/S <AMVOOL> won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the well-head platform's 10000-tonne steel substructure to stand in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a fixed platform would cut construction time enabling field partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several months earlier than previously planned Veslefrikk with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas is located 145 km west of Bergen Statoil estimates the field's total development cost including drilling at 66 billion crowns Planned daily output is 65000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen Its gas will be fed into the Statpipe line which gathers gas from Norway's Statfjord Gullfaks and Oseberg fields Partners on the field are

A/S <NORKOL> said weak sales outside of Europe have forced it to lower its 1987 pre-tax profit forecast by 100 mln crowns and its expected 1987 sales figure by about 150 mln crowns Norsk Data said in August it expected to show a pre-tax profit of between 550 and 600 mln crowns this year The sales figure was lowered after it became clear sales in North America and India would not match earlier predictions the company said in a statement adding: It is  Doubtful that this discrepancy can be compensated by a corresponding extra increase in its European business The company said its sales in Europe remained strong however and were expected to grow by 25 to 35 pct in 1987 Norsk Data in August dropped a planned issue of new non-voting shares in the United States Norway and other countries because of unfavourable market conditions The move was seen by Oslo and London securities analysts as a sign the company's rapid growth years might be over Norsk Data showed a 1779 mln crown pre-tax

pakistan,The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn he said government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market he said Haq said the new policy effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1 would be for three years but reviewed every year It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 36 billion dlrs 182 per cent more than in the previous year and imports at 523 billion dlrs compared to 563 billion dlrs in 1985/86 He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports specially on raw materials and intermediate goods local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs he said Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports He said that to correct this situation 136 items had freed from import restrictions Previously Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad mainly in the Gulf However the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan announced a new tea import policy saying 70 pct of imports will in future be made through the state Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) Commerce Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a television broadcast that no more than one-third of the remaining 30 pct allocated to the private sector would be permitted to come from any one country The new policy was announced some three months after the government suspended import licences and ordered an inquiry into tea purchase policy Traders said the move was designed to put pressure on Kenya which provided some 48 pct of Pakistan's 75-80 mln kilo annual tea imports to buy Pakistani manufactured goods in exchange Liptons and Brooke Bond two units of Britain's Unilever Plc control 95 pct of Pakistan's hard-pack tea market traders said Haq who is also Planning Minister was outlining a new three-year trade policy from the start of financial 1987/88 on July 1 Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum three pct from 45 pct on October 25 It said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes to non-Iraqi Arab ports would be reduced to 30 pct from 45 A conference spokesman declined to say why the move was taken at a time of heightened tension in the Gulf 
papua-new-guinea,Asian cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates International Coffee Organization (ICO) Executive Board is to hold a meeting on November 3/4 its first since export quotas were re-introduced early this month An ICO spokesman said the session for the first time under the chairmanship of Bruno Caron of France will review the market situation and the operation of quotas On November 5 the six exporters making up the ICO Board of Management of the Promotion Fund will review its program for the 1987/88 year (Oct/Sept) and items left over from 1986/87 On November 2 a six nation working group will consider stock verification in Papua New Guinea

philippines,US Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the US For growth Given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit

Manila and the less important Makati exchanges yesterday with much of the activity among centavo priced stocks brokers said The turnover was more than double the record of 11 billion shares worth 1181 million pesos set on Wednesday Brokers said rising gold prices caused mining shares to shoot up three weeks ago and other sectors followed Share prices continued their rise even when the gold price fell back to 450 dlrs an ounce due to rising confidence in President Corazon Aquino's handling of the economy they said Brokers said Aquino's handling of the 18-year-old communist insurgency and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates also contributed to the rise Blue chip stocks such as those of San Miguel Corp and Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) have risen 25 pct in three weeks and the trend is upward in the medium term although a temporary correction is overdue they said Since the surge began on May 26 Manila's Mining index has risen to 57004 points from 40424 its

place in the new programme and is negotiating the purchase of Delta's assembly plant Concepcion declined to say how many car assemblers would be allowed to operate but said they will be required to finance 75 pct of the foreign exchange needed to import completely-knocked-down kits The balance will be provided by the central bank he said The trade minister who is also chairman of the BOI said the programme is intended to develop a car parts industry by requiring car firms to use locally-made spare parts He said the plan should keep car prices at reasonable levels Tax currently accounts for 40 pct of the total cost of a car Philippines and its foreign creditor banks will sign formal documents in mid-July to restructure part of its debt the Central Bank said A spokesman told reporters the documents would formalise the agreement reached in March on the restructuring of 103 billion dlrs out of a total foreign debt of 282 billion The interest rate spread agreed was 7/8 of a percentage point over LIBOR The spokesman gave no date for the signing Manila had demanded a renegotiation after Argentina won a 13/16 of a percentage point spread but it later dropped this demand explosive device blew up in the Philippine Congress building early on Tuesday a congressional security official said He said no-one was injured in the blast which damaged a telephone booth on the second floor at about 0825 local time (0025 GMT) Captain Rosalo Ylagan head of congressional security said the device could have been a home-made bomb or a large firecracker The explosion was being investigated he added No congressmen were in the building at the time Corazon Aquino said the Philippines was closely monitoring interest rates in the wake of Monday's record drop on Wall Street and steep declines in Manila and other Asian stock markets We will monitor these developments closely and will continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in economic activity around the world Aquino told a meeting of 13 major Philippine business groups The Philippines as a trading country in the world economy depends on the continued health and growth of both the world economy and the world trading system she said The Manila Stock Exchange composite index plunged 10549 points or 1179 pct by the midday close to 78954 depressed by the record 508 point fall of the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday The Philippines in addition as a large borrower nation is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the world and will carefully monitor the impact of these developments on interest rates on gold and on commodity prices Aquino said We welcome the statements from world leaders that urge calm in the present difficult situation she added Philippine coconut industry has greeted with relief the defeat in the US Senate of a bill requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats The bill which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture Committee on Monday could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year in lost exports the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said Naturally we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another Senate bill a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of the Philippines (UCAP) PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close with eight senators voting for it 10 against and one abstaining The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during the debate Coconut oil is high in saturated fats but unlike saturated animal fats they do not enter the blood and lymph systems leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease he said US Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour of domestic unsaturated alternatives Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated against imports and would damage the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products in 1986 up from 477 mln in 1985 UCAP figures show Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use account for about half of that total PCA's Romero said Corazon Aquino said economic growth took priority over debt repayments but she sought to dispel fears that the Philippines would not honour a July agreement rescheduling 132 billion dlrs of debt In a speech to 13 major business groups Aquino said Our policy has been very clear fm the start -- growth must take priority for the plain and simple reason that if we have no money to pay we can't And if we starve the nation of essential services there may be no one around to honour the debt Aquino said her officials would try to get all 483 creditor banks to sign the debt rescheduling pact by the November 15 effective date That should end speculation and remove at least one excuse for hoarding dollars Aquino said Violent fluctuations in the peso's exchange rate and the end of a 17-month bull run in local stock markets have triggered dollar-hoarding Aquino said the country's foreign debt which rose to nearly 29 billion dlrs in April was growing even without fresh borrowing Debt servicing took up 40 pct of the budget and 45 pct of export earnings Aquino said Over the next six years the Philippines would be paying its creditors 20 billion dlrs while getting only four billion dlrs in new loans Aquino acknowledged there were grave doubts about her government's ambitious privatisation program There is always an excuse for government not to sell she said but she added: I want government to get out of business She said non-performing assets would be sold in open bidding and Filipinos and foreigners would compete on equal terms Manila-based International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) said West German agricultural scientist Klaus Lampe will take over as its director-general in early 1988 succeeding MS Swaminathan An IRRI statement said Lampe 56 is currently senior adviser to the German Agency for Technical Cooperation at Eschborn and was a former head of the agriculture section of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation It said Swaminathan who has headed IRRI since 1982 will concentrate on environmental and agricultural issues proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the US Senate The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote virtually snuffing out US soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year A similar proposal has made no headway in the House Sen Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package I don't see this as a trade issue I see it as giving American consumers the information they need he said Proponents of the measure including the American Soybean Association have claimed palm palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease The US soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils imported primarily from Malaysia Indonesia and the Philippines But Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind) read a letter from US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter who said the proposal blatantly discriminates against imports would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils The committee voted largely along party lines with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure Philippine Senate approved a proposal to repay loans owed by a private company to speed up the signing of a 132 billion dlr rescheduling agreement with foreign banks It concerns a Barclays Bank managed loan to fertilizer company Planter Products Inc said Teofisto Paterno chairman of the foreign debt committee President Corazon Aquino had accused some creditor banks of non-too-subtle coercion in threatening to refuse to sign the rescheduling accord until the loan problem was settled Over 30 of Philippines' 483 creditor banks still have to sign the agreement before the November 15 deadline Philippine 1987 inflation rate will rise to 48 pct from 074 pct in 1986 if the government implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10 pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight pesos for agriculture workers would push the full year average higher to 54 pct she told the Senate last week The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation rate to 116 pct in December compared with the predicted 144 pct if the government's recommendation is implemented Solita said Both were proposed last month Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 45 pct by the National Economic and Development Authority early this month In the first three months of the year inflation was a negative 05 06 and 07 pct respectively rising to 10 25 and 46 pct in April May and June the National Statistics Office said The annual inflation rate rose to 58 pct in June 62 pct in July and 615 and 6188 pct in August and September respectively the National Statistics Office said It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water prices The government's six and eight peso wage increases would displace up to 20000 workers Monsod said bringing the number of unemployed to 42 mln or 192 pct of the population Philippines' trade deficit widened to 542 mln dlrs in the eight months to end-August from 159 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period the National Statistics Office said It said exports in the eight-month period rose to 358 billion dlrs from 318 billion in 1986 while imports rose to 412 billion dlrs from 334 billion a year earlier The country's trade deficit totalled 202 mln dlrs in 1986

rwanda,Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996 A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000 The PTA set up in 1982 groups Burnudi the Comoros Djibouti Ethiopia Kenya Lesotho Malawi Mauritius Rwanda Somalia Swaziland Tanzania Uganda Zambia and Zimbabwe PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items 
saudi-arabia,Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output according to the kingdom's main producing company Aramco Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 1665 billion in 1985 while gas reserves jumped by 77 pct to 1358 trillion cu ft from 1261 trillion the company's annual report said Aramco responsible for all Saudi production except about 200000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait increased production to 469 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 304 mln barrels a year earlier Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market In the process prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304178 bpd from 316310 said the report carried on the official Saudi Press Agency The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985 Aramco's only refinery at Ras Tannurah processed 14244 mln barrels (390246 bpd) of crude last year The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530000 bpd during the year enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products the report said The country's other five smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation Petromin -- produced around 750000 bpd last year Sulphur production rose to 123 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998707 tonnes in 1985 During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4000 tonnes per day the report said Aramco said it awarded 1303 contracts last year worth 14 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said United States said Kuwait was discussing plans to lease privately-owned US tankers to transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of its own vessels under American flags State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley who made the disclosure about the tankers also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering US flag vessels with the Maritime Administration Oakley said She emphasized however that if some charter arrangement could be worked out it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis In both cases the ships would be eligible for US Navy escort in the Gulf she said The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan administrator of the Martime Administration as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company whose identify he did not know that chartered vessels flying the US flag would be protected the newspaper reported Concerning Saudi Arabia Oakley said we are moving forward in our talks  on how we can tailor our efforts and security cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said acting governor of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company Petromin Jamal Hassan Jawa has retired at his own request oil industry sources said They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi head of organisation planning in Petromin would take over as acting governor Jawa held the post since his predecessor Abdul-Hadi Taher left in a major oil industry shake up last December The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the post permanently The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil market The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20 years Industry sources said that despite huge resources Saudi Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut Hisham Nazer who replaced Yamani successfully led an OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel last December Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia does business the sources said The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz who earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of Petroleum and Minerals and former Deputy Planning Minister Faisal Beshir They also list Abdulla Bakr President of the University of Petroleum and Minerals economist Ali Jonahi Ahmed Shinawi and Zuheir Masoud director of Jeddah Islamic Port Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz was thanked by the Reagan administration for his country's close and closed-mouthed cooperation with Washington in the Gulf a senior US official said The Saudis are being very cooperative It would be nice if the Saudis would go more public but it's their real estate said the official who asked not to be named He declined to describe what sort of help the Saudis were providing saying that Saudi officials are reluctant to acknowledge their role in the Gulf where the United States has stationed forces to protect shipping lanes The prince met Vice President George Bush on Monday after US naval forces attacked offshore Iranian oil platforms in what Washington said was retaliation for an Iranian attack on a ship moored off Kuwait and flying the US flag Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack the prince who is here on an official visit replied I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower The senior US official said his remark was an endorsement of the US attack Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz met for an hour with Vice President George Bush on Monday after US naval forces destroyed one Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and raided another Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack the Crown Prince who is here on an official visit replied I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower His remark appeared to be an implicit endorsement of the US action which the Pentagon said came in retaliation for last Friday's Iranian missile attack on a US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Administration officials said Bush had assured the Crown Prince the United States would stay the course in the Gulf They said Prince Abdullah who is deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia and commander of the kingdom's national guard was very supportive of the US role in the strategic waterway Before meeting with Bush the Crown Prince paid a brief courtesy call on President Reagan During his stay in Washington he was also scheduled to meet with Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leaders of the House and Senate foreign policy committees supplies of OPEC crude weighing on world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the US Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday analysts said December loading rose to 1965 dlrs up 45 cents before falling to around 1905/15 later unchanged from last Friday Fundamentals are awful said Philip Lambert analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 185 mln bpd little changed from September levels Peter Nicol analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank said OPEC production could be about 185-190 mln in October and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 185 mln bpd The US Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the US Flag the Sea Isle City It was struck by a missile believed to be Iranian in Kuwaiti waters and was the first hit on a US Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war The US Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday also believed struck by an Iranian missile Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the US Attack analysts said They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz through which around eight mln bpd passes isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the US Or Iran they said Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities analysts said But they saw the US Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks with some describing it as responsible Geoffrey Pyne analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew said he was impressed by the sensible US Response The US Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response Today's action by the US Was not escalatory Pyne said Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the US Strike was a responsible retaliation with the US Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view however He said he was unable to see what the US Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia whose interests the US Is supposedly defending will feel less secure as a result of the US Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a US Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula close to Kuwait analysts said The later downtrend followed confirmation of a US Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact and finding it less serious than first thought took profits taking prices lower analysts and traders said Supreme Court let stand a ruling that Northrop Corp <NOC> must pay 31 mln dlrs to a company controlled by Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi The court denied a Northrop appeal challenging a US arbitration tribunal's ruling that it pay 31 mln dlrs in commissions and interest stemming from arms contracts it won from Saudi Arabia in the early 1970s Northrop seeking to sell F-5 fighter aircraft and supporting services to Saudi Arabia hired Khashoggi's firm in 1970 as its marketing representative Northrop paid more than 17 mln dlrs in commissions to Khashoggi's firm Triad International Marketing from 1971 to 1975 US Defense Department records showed that Northrops' sales to Saudi Arabia during this period totaled 42 billion dlrs The legal battle dates back to 1979 when Khashoggi began arbitration proceedings seeking payment of more than 150 mln dlrs in commissions due under his agreement with Northrop A federal judge in 1984 threw out the arbitration panel's award of 31 mln dlrs to Khashoggi's firm but a US Court of Appeals reinstated it last March group Boliden AB said it had agreed with Saudi state agency General Petroleum and Mineral Organisation (Petromin) to open a gold mine in Saudi Arabia to exploit one of the world's richest deposits of the metal Boliden spokesman Goran Paulson told the Swedish group would be responsible for the technical side of the operation and would have no control over the product itself He said one option under discussion for refining the gold ore would be to ship it to Boliden's Ronnskar copper smelter in northern Sweden Paulson declined to give a figure for the deal but said it was strategically important since it increased Boliden's presence in Saudi Arabia Representatives from Petromin have visited Ronnskar alreadyWe see Saudi Arabia as the expansion area of the future he said The new mine which is being developed at Mahd adh Dhahab in the west of the country and should open in the first half of 1988 would have an annual output of about 3000 kilos of gold smelted from around 120000 tons of ore he said Boliden already owns 50 pct of a gold ore deposit in Saudi Arabia but the new venture will be the first Saudi mine to open in modern times This is a breakthrough for Boliden's sales of mining technology and knowhow said the group's chief executive Kjell Nilsson Energy Secretary John Herrington arrived in Rabat on Monday after a tour of the Gulf and the Middle East Herrington who is scheduled to meet King Hassan during his 24-hour official visit said on arrival he would discuss regional and international issues with Moroccan leaders Morocco is the last stop of a tour that has taken Herrington to Iraq Kuwait Qatar Bahrain Saudi Arabia and Egypt Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said Japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG the sources said They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan the sources said Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions traders said They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 21 pct a year from 1986 through 1991 Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987 when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase the sources said The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 195 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987 the sources said But when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market they said Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year of which 53 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia 33 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer the sources said The Japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 1752 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January the trade sources said Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement Under the present contract Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said When we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one 
singapore,US Secretary of State George Shultz warned members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) they could no longer rely on increased exports to the US For growth Given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 oil traders said They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 166 mln bpd from the 183 mln agreed in December There are light oversupplies now but OPEC  Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter and is in effect putting pressure on end-users a European crude oil trader said In Tokyo one oil analyst said There's no reason to expect a weak market from now on A Japanese oil trader also based in Tokyo said We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai a benchmark crude they expect price increases over the next few days August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 1735 dlrs above Friday's 1715-20 range but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 1742 Even prices of light Mideast grades such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes are expected to improve from recent weak positions 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least They said that after initial jumps they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and US Stockbuilding for winter they added There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high said an international trader in Tokyo Another Tokyo trader was less bullish For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat A Singapore trade source said There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota was a bearish factor to be considered Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies dealers said in Singapore are planning to further expand their treasury securities equities and debt instruments activities in line with global financial markets bankers and economists told Banks are moving towards treasury activities because they see them as a vital link in global capital and foreign exchange markets Clemente Escano vice-president of Union Bank of Switzerland said Central to that link is the Asian Dollar Market's pool of funds with deposits estimated at 212 billion dlrs in March Banks are fond of booking and tapping offshore Asian Dollar Market funds here for a variety of reasons including low taxes New impetus has come to this market with growth of 52 billion dlrs in the year to March partly due to the liberalisation of financial markets in Japan leading to an increase in interbank activity bankers said Despite the slowdown in traditional loan syndications in the region the offshore market has continued to grow as banks rebundle and securitise their assets creating new generations of tradeable debt instruments bankers said Singapore's daily turnover in foreign exchange dealing has increased to 30 billion US Dlrs in 1987 against 21 billion last year according to Finance Minister Richard Hu Susumu Sakaguchi manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank said the 22 Japanese banks in Singapore were expanding their foreign exchange departments which accounted for at least 30 to 40 pct of total bank activities last year Sakaguchi said the liberalisation of the Toyko market stimulated Asian Dollar deposits and foreign exchange turnover and is leading to active Japanese futures trading on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange Robin Tomlin managing director of Singapore International Merchant Bankers Ltd said international merchant banks cluster in Singapore because of the tax incentives presence of major players and shift in regional capital flows Tomlin pegged much of the future of the Singapore banking industry to securities and equities In 1988 we should see an expansion of securities trading following the link-up of the Stock Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Automated Quotation System (SESDAQ) with the London exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) he said Equity and equity-linked issues have dominated the financial markets here to date because of buoyant domestic and international stock markets Tomlin said privatisation programmes both in Singapore and abroad would encourage huge flows of capital through the banks Applications received for the 30 mln Singapore Airline shares offered last week were worth 6011 mln Singapore dlrs The share offer by Sembawang Maritime Ltd raked in a record 68 billion Singapore dlrs in May this year Bankers said Singapore's privatisations and links with exchanges abroad showed its determined international stance Singapore's four major local banks have been venturing into stockbroking the new government securities market and SESDAQ competing successfully for business with the merchant banks Tomlin said merchant banks will continue to play an important role in the Singapore domestic capital markets but the modest size of the total market would limit the potential of new entrants Bankers said a total of 650 mln US Dlrs was raised in the Singapore capital market last year and the volume of new issues would to grow in 1987 Total lending by banks in Singapore fell by 104 billion dlrs in March 1987 compared with last year following the trend towards asset management services and other capital market activities Hans-Rudolf Schaub the senior vice-president and manager of Swiss Bank Corp said his bank has chosen Singapore as its Asian treasury centre because of favourable tax rules for offshore banks political stability and economic growth He said the bank might set up a securities portfolio management service here in addition to its existing links in international money market services with Zurich and New

somalia,Fifteen countries in Eastern and Southern Africa have agreed to cut tariffs on regional trade by 10 pct every two years up to 1996 A statement by the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) which seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the north to Lesotho in the south said the governments would make the first tariff cut next year In 1996 they would assess the impact of the tariff reductions and work out a new timetable for the complete elimination of all barriers to trade by the year 2000 The PTA set up in 1982 groups Burnudi the Comoros Djibouti Ethiopia Kenya Lesotho Malawi Mauritius Rwanda Somalia Swaziland Tanzania Uganda Zambia and Zimbabwe PTA sources said the agreement averted a split between members wanting more progress towards free trade and weaker states concerned about the effects on customs revenue The reductions cover only a common list of 300 or so widely traded commodities and goods but PTA sources said the organisation planned to expand the list to include 425 items 
south-africa,South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 325 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government's target of three pct growth for 1987 the Reserve Bank said The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price a rise in the nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 US Cents It noted the growth rate had slowed from 45 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term foreign debt Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 743 billion rand in the first quarter compared with a surplus of 724 billion rand in 1986 The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985 African staff of the US Bank Citicorp <CCI> said they will challenge its plans to sell local operations and withdraw from the country Employees said they had written to Citicorp chief executive John Reed protesting against the way the disinvestment deal has been handled They said that they were not consulted on the sale of Citicorp's local subsidiary Citibank NA Ltd to South Africa's First National Bank <BCLJJ> The letter signed by most of the bank's 175 staff hints at legal action against Citicorp unless it reviews the disinvestment arrangement We are seriously considering legal action a senior Citibank employee told There has been no consultation with South African staff and that runs contrary to American corporate thinking in this country he added Citicorp announced the 130 mln rand cash sale on Tuesday with an effective date of July 1 First National Bank's managing director Chris Ball said his bank was essentially buying the skills of Citibank's specialist employees and disclosed that the American bank's assets in South Africa totalled only 15 mln rand Ball indicated that the bank's staff had been told of the sale and agreed to stay on in the bank's employ Citibank's staff 40 pct of whom are black have complained that the disinvestment accord bars local employees from jobs with Citicorp anywhere in the world for five years They say that this provision amounts to a restraint clause which is legally challengeable This could threaten the divestment plan say industry sources since most of the purchase price as Ball said is for employee skills and expertise and not assets The Citibank employee challenge is seen as more important than a previous ultimately unsuccessful challenge on job security issues by General Motors employees after the US Automaker announced its pull out because valuable managers and other key staff are involved in protest The employees assert that the Citicorp sale unlike similar disinvestment moves announced this week by <Ford Motor Co> and <ITT Corp> include no portion of South African profits for local employees or black community projects We always thought they would offer a settlement to staff here in keeping with their image as an equal opportunity employer said a senior black employee adding We had no idea that the age of slavery was still alive for platinum could reach 34 mln ounces by 1991 compared with an estimated offtake of 288 mln in 1986 Chris Clark platinum marketing director for Johnson Matthey Plc said Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250000 ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts currently the largest single application for platinum Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70000 ounces Clark predicted in his speech the text of which was released in London today Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further increase in investment buying and may well be cautious He said South Africa was the most likely source of additional supplies and will need to increase output by about 500000 ounces to meet increased demand The capital investment required to produce the additional output would be around one billion US Dlrs and the political climate may make it difficult to raise the money he said The Soviet Union whose exports have declined since the 1970s might increase sales to the West by about 50000 ounces Clark said The very probability of a growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long-term Clark said American Corp of South Africa Ltd <ANGLJ> has attacked a key apartheid law barring blacks from living in white residential areas as racially discriminatory and economically wasteful The Group Areas Act was also a misuse of resources the South African economy can no longer sustain the directors said in the annual report released today These latest remarks by South Africa's biggest company follows past criticisms by the firm that apartheid was economically inefficient The company said the country's prospects for economic growth had improved in the past few months after two years of deep recession but cautioned that the economic outlook was heavily dependent on a solution to South Africa's political turmoil The directors said the resumption of sustained economic growth was dependent on stable domestic conditions and the restoration of normal international relationships The South African government this year is targeting three pct real growth in gross domestic product against an increase of less than one pct last year A moderate rate of growth in the year ahead should not give rise to strains on the balance payments provided there is not a substantial deterioration in export earnings or an acceleration of capital outflows Anglo American said Anglo American last month reported a 258 pct advance in net attributable profit to 15 billion rand in the year to March 31 African year-on-year consumer price inflation in September fell to 155 pct from 163 pct in August Central Statistics Office figures show The monthly rise in the all items index (base 1980) was 13 pct to 2734 in September after edging up to 2700 in August A year ago the index stood at 2367 and year-on-year consumer price inflation at 197 pct major South African mining house on Monday reported two of its gold mines suffered huge losses as a result of a black miners' strike in August which crippled about half the country's crucial gold mines Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company one of the six major mining houses said the two mines suffered a combined net loss of 97 mln dlrs in the three months to end-September compared with a profit of 86 mln dlrs in the preceding quarter It was the first indication of the real economic impact of the biggest wage strike in the history of the gold mining industry which accounts for nearly half the value of South Africa's total exports The results were pretty disastrous primarily due to the impact of the strike Ken Maxwell head of Johannesburg Consolidated's gold division told a news conference in Johannesburg We haven't recovered from the strike yet he said adding that 70 percent of underground mining at the group's biggest mine Randfontein Estates was halted by the three-week strike Johannesburg Consolidated and its controlling company the giant Anglo American Corp were hard-hit by the three-week miners' strike but refused to disclose production losses Anglo American is due to report its quarterly gold-mine profits later this week Africa must drive down its inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further decline in the rand said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic review The bank said that without a major drop in the inflation rate the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and the rand is around 4953 US Cents Most economists estimate continued high inflation Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for the rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year black miners have been killed and two injured in a rock fall three km underground at a South African gold mine the owners said on Sunday <Rand Mines Properties Ltd> one of South Africa's big six mining companies said in a statement that the accident occurred on Saturday morning at the <East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd> mine at Boksburg 25 km east of Johannesburg A company spokesman could not elaborate on the short statement

spain,Spain's private bank staff started a one and a half day strike over wage demands but its impact was not yet clear Spokesmen for several of the main banks said strikers at their Madrid headquarters appeared to be a small minority They had yet to receive reports from branches Unions called out the 160000 employees to press for cuts in working hours and an eight pct wage rise Banks implemented a 475 pct wage increase last month handling companies said they were hiring twice the usual number of dockers to offset an intermittent strike in Spanish ports Spanish dockers began a nine-day strike on Wednesday in which they only work alternate hours in protest at government plans to partially privatize port services socialist government is aiming to restore confidence of foreign banks in its power generation sector by pushing through a complete reform of the industry's tariff structure a senior government official said Most foreign banks have been refusing to extend fresh loans to the mainly privately-owned sector since Fuerzas Electricas de Catalunya SA (FECSA) a major utility defaulted on two billion dlrs of foreign currency debt earlier this year Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo De la Dehesa told in an interview that a new government-inspired tariff mechanism providing for automatic increases each year would guarantee the long term viability of the industry He said a bill would be sent before the Spanish Cortes (parliament) this summer enabling tariff increases from next year to be set under the new system De la Dehesa declined to give technical details of the scheme known here as the Marco Estable (stable framework) but said future tariff increases would make up for the failure of past adjustments to cover rising costs The utility companies have a captive market and if they are assured a satisfactory tariff structure they will have the best of all possible worlds to do business in De la Dehesa said FECSA's debt crisis has caused concern among foreign and Spanish bankers who expressed fears that other utility companies may default for lack of fresh funds unless confidence in the industry's future is restored Spain's 14 leading power utilities have massive debts with short and medium term exposure of 4377 billion pesetas at the end of last year A significant proportion of it is in foreign currency bankers say The new tariff plan currently being discussed with representatives of the utility industry and Spanish bankers would shortly be presented to foreign creditors De la Dehesa said FECSA's problems were precipitated in February when the stock exchange suspended trading in the company's stock on the grounds that it could not meet its debts FECSA was a special case De la Dehesa said but the banks took fright and extended the crisis to the rest of the utility sector We really did not expect this Much foreign bank lending to the utility sector has been on the strength of a government commitment made to international bankers at a presentation in London in 1983 to support the industry I think if foreign banks were lending on the basis of declarations by our energy authorities in London they will have all the more reason to do so when the new tariff system is passed into law De la Dehesa said This is going to be a palpable fact not just a declaration he added De la Dehesa said he believed that once confidence was restored in the sector as a whole FECSA's debt problems would be quickly solved A recently formed steering committee representing FECSA's foreign creditors is due to meet FECSA managers in Barcelona on Tuesday for a round of talks on rescheduling the ailing utility's debt FECSA's General Manager Jose Zaforteza told he thought the climate of the talks would be greatly improved by the new tariff proposals You cannot go far wrong when you are managing an electrical utility provided the tariffs you charge are sufficient to cover your costs Zaforteza said The General Manager of the Madrid branch of a US Bank which has lent money to FECSA said there would be little significant progress in the rescheduling talks until details of the tariff proposals were known We cannot make any projections about FECSA's ability to pay its debts unless we know what the tariffs are going to be he said If you make annual increases over a period of years of four five or six pct in each case it's a completely different ball game he said private banks in central Madrid and Barcelona closed as Spanish bank staff went on strike for more pay union officials and employers said Union officials said there was at least partial response to the strike call in the rest of Spain But a spokesman for the employers' Banks Association said banks in many towns were working almost normally Unions called the strike today and tomorrow morning to press for shorter working hours and an eight pct pay increase Employers offered a 475 pct wage increase last month and wet weather in northern western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year Continental Inc said it sold its 50 interest in Sociedad Iberica de Molturacion SA (Simsa) a soybean and sunflower seed processing company based in Madrid Spain Staley's investment in Simsa no longer fit its overall coporate strategy and an agreement to sell the interest was completed in May it said Staley said the Simsa transaction will not have a material effect on its balance sheet

copper and alloy products and its sales of 87000 tonnes of output in 1986 amounted to 22 billion pesetas Outokumpu's turnover in 1986 was 758 billion markka European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said farm minister Carlos Romero speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers called for action to help the Spanish maize market Spanish diplomatic sources said Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year they said They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the meeting European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year an EC commission spokesman said He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on US Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones the spokesman said Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming US Manufacturers It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France Britain West Germany and Spain the countries involved in the Airbus project property firm <Renta Inmobiliaria SA> is negotiating to buy the property assets of US media company Cannon Group Inc <CAN> Renta's

switzerland,The loopholes in Swiss banking supervision must be closed in a step-by-step manner Swiss National Bank Vice-President Markus Lusser said The integration of financial markets had blurred the distinction between banks and bank-like finance companies and the varying degree of regulation of the two sectors had a destablizing effect he told the Association of Foreign Banks It is in the interest of all market participants that these institutes (finance companies) be brought as soon as possible under banking supervision he said in remarks prepared for delivery to the association's annual meeting It was important however that bringing finance companies under the banking law did not undermine Switzerland as a financial marketplace Lusser said It is decisive for its future that it succeeds in attracting and holding a wide variety of banks financial intermediaries and financial experts he said Lusser also urged greater harmonization of regulatory practice with other countries in view of the integration of world markets and the internationalization of the banking business AG <CIGZZ> said it acquired a minority stake in British cereal breeding company <New Farm Crops Ltd> It

tonnes citing low demand the loss of US Market share in the two main importing countries Britain and the Netherlands and the sale of nuts intended for export at a premium in the US Domestic market Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop at 215000 tonnes compared with 264000 the previous year Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 US Groundnut crop and forecast a resurgence in US

expenditure is seen increasing 71 mln to 2595 billion next year After internal transfers net income was planned to total 637 mln francs The ministry also announced that higher than expected income during 1987 would likely boost this year's surplus significantly higher than the 171 mln francs budgeted The ministry said the encouraging development of Switzerland's finances was due to steady economic growth since 1983 and the government's conservative fiscal policy Although the dollar's weakness is likely to dampen economic growth slightly in 1988 by depressing exports domestic investment and consumer demand were expected to remain strong Real gross national product growth was seen rising two pct while annual inflation was also projected to reach two pct will use most of its budget surplus projected for 1988 to redeem its debt the Finance Ministry said The government's plan calls for income to exceed expenditure by 13 billion Swiss francs next year After internal transfers net income was seen reaching 637 mln francs The ministry said in a press release the surplus would be used for the most part for redeeming debt but also help finance environmental protection public transport and research and development projects Thanks to the favourable liquidity situation debt will be able to be repaid the ministry said That will reduce the net interest burden to 22 pct of net income the lowest point since 1974 Finance Minister Otto Strich said the government plans to continue its tight fiscal policy as it moves toward its goal of reducing taxes In the meantime it will concentrate on redeeming its debt he said in a statement In that way the interest payment burden on state finances can be reduced and the government's ability to set policy broadened he said profit

160 mln Swiss franc five pct 12-year bond priced at 1005 pct lead manager Credit Suisse said Subscriptions run until Oct 29 Swiss Banking Commission hopes to introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual liquidity requirements Commission Director Kurt Hauri told the main consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in interest rates which occurs at the end of every month By effectively reducing liquidity requirements it would also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain West Germany and the United States he said The commission wants to move to a system of average liquidity requirements where banks have to hold reserves equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated over the month as a whole The current system described as a Swiss special case by Hauri forces banks to comply with requirements generally only at the end of each month The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money market rates overshadowed by the approach of the end-month called the ultimo with consequent high costs for the banks who are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when overnight rates hit triple figures due to a combination of the half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its money supply target Although the rise shocked the bank into more flexibility the problem remained The reform proposal which Hauri said had been planned for years was given to banks and other interested parties for comment on September 30 They have until the end of this month to suggest alterations Subject to such changes and to the government go-ahead it will come into force on January 1

Telecommunications Union which regulates communications worldwide decided at the end of a five-week conference to allow mobile phone systems to be linked with satellites telecommunications officials said Until now car phones have been linked with land stations and have been limited mainly to urban areas The new ruling will make it easier for calls to be made from remote regions The meeting which finished over the weekend also decided to allow a radio determination satellite system which would enable fleet owners to trace to within about 15 metres the movements of their lorries or cars or ships around the world sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and matching falls around Europe may have been overdone but the mood on financial markets is precarious Swiss securities analysts and economists said Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening on enormous volume triggered by the slide on Wall Street and the threat of renewed currency instability I have never experienced anything like this and I've been in the business for 20 years said Bernhard Wyttenbach head of European research at Union Bank of Switzerland The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on US Monetary authorities This weekend US Treasury Secretary James Baker publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary policy He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise currencies was still working but added: On the other hand we will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United States will raise rates Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in Zurich said: The situation is very dangerous Statements by the US Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates Herbert Fritschi director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's financial research department called the sell-off overdone but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks loosen their monetary policy I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over he said The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in with an easy money policy or else there is going to be an economic catastrophe They have to act quickly Wyttenbach said the Black Monday sell-off was clearly exaggerated with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction would come soon First the bad news will reach small investors only in time for tomorrow's market when there could be another smaller selling wave As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key -- then we'll get a strong movement upward Wyttenbach said But that may not come soon People are simply worried that in America where the market has now fallen by 18 pct since August the bull market is over he said People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988 Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current problems and the weak dollar Wyttenbach said We do not have a mark problem we have a dollar problem he added but said the biggest culprit was the new chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board Alan Greenspan Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest rates might have to rise As a central banker he shouldn't do that Wyttenbach said There is a danger that we will fall back into the 1970s he said We have a real crisis of confidence in Greenspan I would much rather have a Volcker Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11 Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: I'm relatively optimistic because the situation looks too bad The Fed certainly has to intervene He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take any significant steps adding that the focus of attention remains on the United States The panic started in New York it has to end there The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting they not sell into a panicked market but wait a while before deciding what to do prospect of a dominant alliance of socialists and environmentalists ended as the Social Democrats became the biggest losers in Swiss parliamentary elections Projections by Swiss

taiwan,Recent government moves to curb capital inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar against the US Currency officials and bankers said Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the reserves rose only about 500 mln US Dlrs in the past two weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the US Dollar Chang said The pace of increase in our reserves is much slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable He said the reserves mainly the result of the trade surplus with the US Rose at the rate of two to three billion US Dlrs a month between January and May The reserves the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany now total well over 60 billion US Dlrs On June 2

transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks registering a fall of up to 30 pct Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against the US Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five to eight cents in May The bank dealers said the central bank which had previously bought US Dollars heavily sold at least 11 billion US Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial demand They said they expected the government to keep the local dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to businesses

yesterday Keh Fei-Lo vice president of First Commercial Bank said It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow is quite successful Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from Washington over the large US Trade deficit with Taiwan Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed imports of machinery and production equipment because of exchange rate uncertainty he said The stable exchange rate would help boost imports particularly from the United States joint committee of Taiwan's soybean

special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist and his aides

importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth major tin exporter and producer <Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to Thaisarco a Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RDAS> unit to less than 20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne average commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported tin lapse on June 3 The taxes levied on the tin mines rose to 44 pct this month from 11 pct ad valorem over the past year The lower levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985 Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100 tonnes per day As a result he said Thailand could fail to fill some 3000 tonnes of its 19000 tonne tin export quota allocated by the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year ending February 1988 Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to allocate a lower quota next year Yoot said The supplies shortage should prove temporary however because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late this month Yoot said The department said Thailand exported 7715 tonnes of tin during January/May compared with 8462 tonnes a year ago has been a fairly hectic trading week in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby shipments London trader Woodhouse Drake and Carey said in its weekly report July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New York futures it said Mid-week saw these same sales covered by the trade at 10/15 points discount Enquiries for July/Sep 15 raw sugars then filtered in and here again traded values rose quickly from 13 points premium to New York July up to 18 Woodhouse said In the Western Hemisphere both Dominican Republic and Mexican nearby raws were bid 15 points discount to July New York and offered five points under but in limited trading it said All the action of the past week has been in the Far East raws market whereas the whites market saw little fresh prospect of nearby offtake Whitehouse added split in the Thai government's main coalition party may prompt Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to dissolve parliament soon Interior Minister Prachuab Suntharangun said He told reporters that Prem was considering new elections because squabbling in the Democrat Party undermined government performance and held up legislation Prem wanted passed But Prem was reluctant to call new elections or reshuffle his cabinet because that too would be likely to result in a wobbly multi-party coalition Prachuab said He declined to say how soon parliament might be dissolved The Democrats one of four parties in the ruling coalition have been split ever since winning 100 of the parliament's 347 seats in elections in July 1986 The current coalition was formed last August and constitutes a hefty parliamentary majority But the Democrats' inability to work well together or with their coalition partners has made the government vulnerable to the small but more cohesive opposition Parliament closed the first of its two annual sessions this month and is scheduled to reconvene in September stock prices plunged on Tuesday as nervous investors unloaded shares on reports of steep declines on major world stock markets Brokers said the Securities Exchange of Thailand Index fell a record 3664 points or nearly eight pct to close at 42237 It's impossible to halt the slide in this situation The market just doesn't behave logically said Sirivat Voravetvuthikun executive vice president of Asian Securities Trading Co Ltd But Sirivat said he did not believe the fall would mark the end of the SET's 16 month bull run which has accelerated during the last two months He expected Thai stocks to fluctuate widely in the next few weeks The slide on Tuesday followed a 1385 point decline of the 97-stock index on Monday when it closed at 45901 Brokers said they were flooded with sell orders when the market opened this morning and a SET announcement urging investors not to panic was ignored The index reached a record 47286 last Friday up 577 pct from end-June and 1282 pct higher than last December SET officials said 77 issues were traded on Tuesday of which all but two declined Of the losers 68 plummeted the daily maximum 10 pct allowed by the exchange Prices on the special foreign column also fell sharply SET vice president Suthichai Chitvanich told reporters the 10 pct floor serves as a restraint making it unnecessary to suspend trading should the panic continue The Thai exchange has lately been gaining on its own strength with most buying coming from local investors Investors should not be unduly influenced by foreign market reports he added Suthichai said sound local fundamentals including low interest rates and promising economic growth favoured investment in the stock market The SET also announced it would release third quarter corporate earnings earlier than expected as part of efforts to shore up public confidence Minister for Trade Negotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on reducing the large subsidies which the European Community and United States grant their farmers Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform the EC Common Agricultural Policy and US Plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction I am hopefully optimistic There is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the USA the EC and the Cairns Group he told reporters Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks on farm subsidies The group which includes Australia and Malaysia advocates free farm trade and says US European and Japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in North and South America the EC and Thailand and leaves for Indonesia on Wednesday Minister for Trade Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major agricultural producers to which Australia and Thailand belong has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral trade talks There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other international trade negotiations he said Duffy here on a three-day visit after talks in the United States The European Community (EC) and Latin America said considerable progress has been made by the group towards fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed countries The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a determination to resist the currently strong protectionist sentiment in the US Congress traders plan to establish a company to regulate maize forward trading in what could be a first step towards a commodities futures exchange

Egyptian government for the supply of 240000 tonnes of Gulf of Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the government selling price Last year CPC bought 120000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through CItoh Officials said plans to buy 240000 tonnes of Basra Light from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several constraints CPC said it could not accept 120000 tonne parcels and proposed to lift 30000 tonnes in eight shipments Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where lifting was to take place could not accept small ships INOC then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30000 tonnes each CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for delivery of Indian requirements later going to Colombo to offload CPC's needs but CPC considered this unsuitable CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since December Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 17 mln tonnes This year it plans to buy 400000 tonnes on the spot market compared with about 13 mln tonnes last year whose shipping has come under repeated attack by Iran has the full support of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies a senior government official said Cabinet spokesman Abdul-Aziz al-Otaibi quoted by the Kuwaiti news agency KUNA yesterday said Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah had told cabinet he had found complete supportAt this delicate phase during visits to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states The GCC an economic and military alliance which has generally supported Iraq over Iran comprises Bahrain Kuwait Oman Qatar Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates agreement to limit output to 166 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost spot prices and enable the group to raise its official reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current 18 dlrs Far East oil industry sources said Fundamentally the market situation is bullish and the official price will be 20 dlrs in January a Japanese refiner said The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC members such as Iraq the United Arab Emirates Kuwait and Qatar demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late US Trading as the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987 output In early Tokyo trade levels were firm at 1730 dlrs for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 1900 dlrs for UK Brent traders said They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into the US Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trades at around 2030 dlrs With WTI at 20 21 or 22 dlrs US Refiners will import Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those grades further said a Japanese oil trader Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot market has further upward potential in the short term having risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that basis there's no reason for prices to go up again today said one international oil trader in Tokyo But I think if there's any sign of a dip it will be bought back up again pretty quickly he added One oil industry analyst concurred There is no reason to expect a weak market from now on He said he expected OPEC to raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9 Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to maintain steady prices Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day compared to its second-half quota of 154 mln they said Its export capability will rise to 25 mln bpd when a new pipeline through Turkey comes onstream in or around September Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350000 bpd against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299000 by discounting up to 20 cents a barrel from official prices the sources said Iran the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price discounts through counter-purchases industry sources said But they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as swing producer cutting production to compensate for higher output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise too high too fast Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln barrels Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises too much an oil industry analyst said Oil Minister Mana Said al-Oteiba arrived in Alexandria last night for a visit to Egypt the national Middle East News Agency (MENA) said It said Oteiba who had just attended the OPEC ministerial meeting in Vienna would stay for several days but gave no details Non-OPEC Egypt has pledged to restrain output to support OPEC's moves to boost oil prices Oil Minister Abdel Hadi Kandeel last week said Egypt plans to leave its oil production of 870000 barrels per day unchanged for the next five years Egypt is able to produce up to one mln bpd on certificates of deposit (CDs) issued today by the United Arab Emirates central bank were unchanged from those on last Monday's offer the bank said The one month yield was set at last week's 6-3/4 pct while two and three month CDs also remained unchanged at 6-13/16 pct The six month yield

countries were accorded terms that were more generous than usually granted by the Club Uganda was given 15 years to repay its debts with a six-year grace period while Mozambique was accorded an exceptionally long 20-year period with 10 years' grace The Club said it approved of both countries' economic and financial programs and would therefore make a contribution to improve their external payments prospects It said both countries faced heavy debt service obligations and low per capita income adding the solution of the countries' debt problems would take a number of years The statement also said Mozambique's limited debt service capacity made borrowing from the International Monetary Fund in the upper credit tranches inappropriate No details were available from the countries'

to attractive prices active trading and the reappearance of the USA as the world's leading producer of peanuts it said Overall exports from China the leading exporter last year will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite quality complaints and difficulties in implementing some earlier high-priced contracts It is too early to say if China can retain its current market share in 1988 Tracomin said of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said current low unit wage costs are helping British exports but wage rises are faster than is comfortable He hoped yesterday's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts of increases in wage rises were wrong saying OECD predictions are somewhat unreliable Productivity is rising very fast and therefore even though wages are going up faster than is comfortable the actual unit cost of labourIs not going up fast at all Lawson said in answer to questions on BBC radio That is one of the reasons why we're doing so well in export markets for example but we could do even better and get unemployment down even faster if there was a more moderate rate of growth in wage increases Lawson added His remarks followed yesterday's news that underlying average earnings were rising 775 pct annually in April up from March's 75 pct increase which sent the UK Government bond market lower and helped trigger inflation worries Lawson said he would not update his own economic forecasts for the UK Until the traditional Autumn Statement on the economy Lawson would not be drawn on whether he will cut the basic rate of tax from the current 27 pct to 25 pct in the next budget due in March 1988 We will certainly achieve it sooner or later he said The latest official data released yesterday showed unit wage costs in manufacturing industry were rising 09 pct annually in the three month period ended April down from a 12 pct rise in the first quarter and sharply below last year's first quarter growth rate of 78 pct

and outstanding letter of credit claims Nigeria and Barclays Bank Plc said in a joint statement The statement was issued during the last of a two day meeting here between the two sides Barclays is a co-chairman of the commercial bank steering committee The statement said Further progress has been made in the 1986/87 rescheduling of medium term public sector debt and outstanding letter of credit claims of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton said lowering interest rates too fast could jeopardise recent economic achievements in the UK In remarks prepared for delivery to businessmen in Birmingham he said prospective returns on real investment are more favourable relative to those on financial assets than for a good number of years It would surely be foolish to put that favourable conjuncture at risk by lowering interest rates prematurely or excessively he said We might enjoy a short-term boost to activity but at the risk of a damaging return to the uncertainty and acrimony of high inflation he added Leigh-Pemberton said he recognised there are some who would argue that interest rates are still too high and deter investment in industry But we should not forget that less than a year ago we were intervening to support sterling and had some temporary difficulty in persuading the markets that a one pct increase in base rates to 11 pct was a sufficient tightening of policy at the time he added Base rate is currently nine pct will be no serious bids at European Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package trade sources said The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the uncertainty remains One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon but the situation will become more serious as time passes However traders said there seem to be few buyers around lessening the disruptive impact of the delay Poland and South Korea who are in the market for feed wheat will be offered intervention grain through special tenders traders said UK Lenders are offering homebuyers fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other interest rates And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in years the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers trying to lock into cheap money The decision to offer fixed rate loans industry officials said reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home mortgage business While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the UK They were the mainstay of the business in the US Up until only a few years ago But in the early 1980s interest rates soared US Lenders mostly savings and loan associations were earning rates as low as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to induce them to retain their accounts As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were forced to merge The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose rates would move in line with the cost of funds We very much have the example of the US Thrifts in mind said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society explaining why his institution for the time being is only offering variable rate mortgages The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders concede they are being forced to undercut each other still more Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for new business officials at all three institutions said The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even below those on the variable rate loans Of course they are less profitable than other (variable rate) mortgages said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc which earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate new mortgage loans But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable loans because It was just another way to attract people to our mortgage product Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed rate mortgages at 99 pct earlier this year The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was exhausted within just a few days according to a spokeswoman Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage she said noting that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct of its 1986 volume In short the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest rates If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the lender is earning an above average return on assets But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won the benefit of cheap money Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates fall further according to Duncan Young managing director Young explained that the company had planned to protect itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a complicated hedging instrument But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations and the company has shelved its plans for the time being He said money market rates were too high to arrange both the mortgages and hedge profitably However he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them This means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond and selling them to an investor For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate mortgages In the US Where fixed rate mortgages are popular again securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money over the past few years Bank Plc said it is withdrawing from market making in Eurobonds and UK Government bonds (gilts) It said in a statement it will maintain an active presence in short-term securities trading swaps and other treasury products building on its strengths in traditional foreign exchange and money markets In the statement Lloyds chief executive Brian Pitman said We have a relatively small position in these two overcrowded markets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to opportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders' investment With this decision Lloyds becomes the second major UK Clearing bank to feel the effects of the deregulation of the London Stock Exchange or Big Bang last October Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc pulled out of equity market making because it did not believe the return justified the costs involved in maintaining and developing a market share Lloyds Treasurer Alan Moore subsequently told that the decision was taken at a board meeting earlier today and had been under discussion for some time He said the move was not a reaction to any losses sustained in the trading of Eurobonds or gilts but rather a result of a strategic review of the future of Lloyds involvement in these markets In the end Lloyds decided these markets did not represent an attractive return to our shareholders he said He noted that Lloyds had not expected its UK Government bond operations would be profitable in the early stages although he declined to discuss the finances of the operation This is an overcrowed market Moore said of the UK Government bond market which began Big Bang with 27 market makers Lloyds withdrawal now leaves the number at 26 Market participants noted that Lloyds was the only one of the clearing banks which did not buy a jobber (middle man) or broker before Big Bang Under the old system the gilt market operated under a separate system which involved separate functions for jobbers and brokers Now these tasks have been taken up by market makers acting as both Moore said that one reason Lloyds decided to withdraw from these markets was that they could no longer justify the commitment of capital that was required to maintain these operations He said Lloyds would make every effort to redeploy employees in these areas within the bank and wet weather in northern western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year of London the insurance market said its offer for a settlement of the five-year old <PCW Underwriting Agencies> affair which involved losses totaling about 235 mln stg was unconditional For the offers to become unconditional there had to be 90 pct acceptance by those Lloyd's members affected by the PCW fraud although this level could be reduced by a caretaker agency set up in 1985 to manage the affair The offers involve one-off cash payments by PCW names - investors who guarantee insurance risks - in exchange for a Lloyd's guarantee ending their exposure to PCW-related claims International Plc <REEDL> said it had no comment to make on UK stock market rumors that Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> may make a bid for the company in order to escape unwelcome offers from Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp <BPCLL> A spokeswoman for Reed said earlier analysts forecasts that a bid for Reed will have to be about 700 mln stg were totally unrealistic adding that its current market is about 27 billion stg service industrial action started early this month will delay the publication of May's UK Overseas trade figures which had been due out next Thursday a Trade and Industry Department statement said A department spokesman said the figures will probably be put back by about a month The June trade figures due in late July will also be delayed he added for platinum could reach 34 mln ounces by 1991 compared with an estimated offtake of 288 mln in 1986 Chris Clark platinum marketing director for Johnson Matthey Plc said Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250000 ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts currently the largest single application for platinum Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70000 ounces Clark predicted in his speech the text of which was released in London today Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further increase in investment buying and may well be cautious He said South Africa was the most likely source of additional supplies and will need to increase output by about 500000 ounces to meet increased demand The capital investment required to produce the additional output would be around one billion US Dlrs and the political climate may make it difficult to raise the money he said The Soviet Union whose exports have declined since the 1970s might increase sales to the West by about 50000 ounces Clark said The very probability of a growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long-term Clark said Bank Plc's <LLOYL> decision to withdraw from making markets in Eurobonds and UK Government bonds (gilts) sent shivers down the spines of other market participants but was viewed as prudent by banking analysts It (the move) really isn't a surprise They lost a lot of money in the early stages of the gilt market and now they want to cut their losses while they can said Keith Brown banking analyst at Greenwell Montagu The question now is how many other gilt market makers will face a similar fate one senior gilt market maker said Eurobond market participants were equally stunned They are the first firm of that size I can remember to have pulled out of eurobond market making altogether said a member of the Association of International Bond Dealers London staff Other Eurobond market participants said that while Lloyds had frequently changed the staff of some of its eurobond operations it was hard to believe they were in trouble With this action Lloyds the third largest UK clearing bank becomes the first UK clearing bank to withdraw from the gilt market following the Big Bang deregulation of the London Stock Exchange in October Earlier this year Midland Bank Plc <MDBLL> the fourth largest clearing bank opted out of making markets in equities on the grounds that the return did not justify the expense It continues as a market maker in gilts however In a prepared statement Lloyds Bank chief executive Brian Pitman said the bank had a relatively small position in these two overcrowded markets and we have decided to reallocate the resources to opportunities which promise a better return on our shareholders investment Lloyds said it would maintain its presence in short-term securities trading swaps and other treasury products Alan Moore Lloyds Treasurer told that the decision was forward looking and followed a strategic review of the prospects for Lloyds in these markets We decided the return just was not attractive he said Although the decision was made at a meeting of Lloyds board this morning Moore said that it had been under consideration for some time He denied that the move was a reaction to events in the trading room although he acknowledged that the bank's gilt operations were not profitable in the early stages of the new market Greenwell's Brown noted that for all of 1986 Lloyds Merchant Bank sustained a loss of 28 mln stg most of which he said were accounted for by the Eurobond and gilt operations For all of 1986 Lloyds reported a pre-tax profit of 700 mln stg Lloyds is so big it can easily absorb these losses Brown said noting that they are minuscule when compared with the bank's exposure to Latin America UK Clearing banks have come under pressure to increase their provisions against bad loans to third world countries since Citibank announced plans to add three billion dlrs to its provisions in mid-May National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBLL> the largest of the clearers became the first of the UK Clearers to follow Citicorp's <CCI> move earlier this week when it said it was adding some 466 mln stg to its sovereign debt provisions Lloyds has the second largest exposure to Latin America after Midland Bank the smallest of the four clearers Lloyds has said it is reviewing the situation and Moore denied that today's action had any connection It is totally unrelated he said Trading in Eurobonds and gilts had ended by the time the announcement was made But market participants were dumbfounded We only heard the news about 20 minutes before the announcement I had no idea it was coming I don't know if I still have job said one trader at Lloyds who declined to be identified Lloyds' Moore said that the bank would do all it could to redeploy the staff affected by the decision in other parts of the bank But even though Lloyds' share of these markets was relatively small other market participants particularly in gilts were unnerved One senior gilt market maker noted that the news comes during a period when both gilt and Eurosterling markets have been battered by the lack of investor participation following the June 11 UK general election Most firms had held long positions on expectations that a return of the ruling Conservative party would prompt heavy demand These expectations have failed to be met and both markets have sustained sizeable losses since the election Lloyds has long been the subject of rumors that it was experiencing problems with its gilt operations and officials have never denied that the early stages were unprofitable Gilt market sources suggested that one of the problems facing Lloyds on the gilt side was its decision to build up its own team It was the only clearer which did not purchase a broker or a jobber (middle man) in the run-up to Big Bang Under the old system these functions have been conducted separately but now market makers perform both tasks But even long before Big Bang market makers had expressed doubts that the gilt market would be large enough to sustain 27 market makers even if turnover increased substantially And with Lloyds withdrawal many market makers believe that some of the remaining 26 may opt to bow out gracefully has been a fairly hectic trading week in raw sugar with China paying market levels for nearby shipments London trader Woodhouse Drake and Carey said in its weekly report July shipment Thai raws traded to China early in the week at fob levels equivalent to 20/25 points discount to July New York futures it said Mid-week saw these same sales covered by

the Western Hemisphere both Dominican Republic and Mexican nearby raws were bid 15 points discount to July New York and offered five points under but in limited trading it said All the action of the past week has been in the Far East raws market whereas the whites market saw little fresh prospect of nearby offtake Whitehouse added International Plc <REEDL> denied rumours on the UK Stock market that it was the target of a takeover bid and said it had received no approach In view of the increase in our share price today I want to make clear that we have not received any bid approaches Reed's chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement Rumours that US Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc <HBJ> might bid for Reed a paper and printing company pushed Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread decline in UK Equity prices Share market analysts said speculators were buying the stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp <BPCLL> Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to take it over analysts added They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's bid for Harcourt was unsuccessful it could turn its attention to Reed Group Plc> which on Friday secured agreement for its bid for <JWT Group Inc> by increasing its offer said it would raise its planned rights issue to raise 213 mln stg instead of 177 mln to finance the deal On Friday the two

ordinary shares at 875p each on a two-for-one basis The issue has been underwritten The remainder of the purchase price would come from a loan facility of up to 260 mln dlrs The issue and the proposed acquisition of JWT remain conditional on the approval of shareholders The original proposal for the rights issue was on the basis of five new shares for every three held The revised version would

reported a drop in pre-tax profits to 162 mln stg from 195 mln previously However King said this result was satisfactory considering the difficulties posed by the Chernobyl disaster and the US Raid on Libya He said British Airways intended to return its tour travel operations to profitability when questioned by shareholders In 1986/87 this division reported an operating loss of nine mln stg the

Chigaga told in an interview it was not true that Western states had threatened to withold financial aid following Zambia's abandonement of a tough IMF-inspired program that included the auctioning of the local kwacha It is only Britain which has openly come out to say it would withhold funds intended for the auction system of foreign exchange Chigaga said All the other countries have said their relationship with us cannot be affected by the abandonment of a system that only lived for 18 months when they have been supporting us for over 20 years now he said Chigaga said that Britain was now

Sea Ltd may indicate a new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln barrels industry analysts said Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the UK Continental shelf tested 9000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API crude oil from the tertiary Alba sand through a three-inch surface choke The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320 mln barrels Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson and Co told He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the field at over one billion barrels but given the low gravity of oil the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25 pct Analysts said the results were encouraging but the potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be plugged and a sidetrack drilled The field seems to be shallow and widespread which will require a multi-platform development in recovery pushing costs up Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil found would require additional costs in recovery the test well showed that it flows well Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be recovered Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told However Chevron officials declined to comment on the analysts' reserve estimates They said that without further research and drilling in the area this summer they would not disclose any reserve figures Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial and developed there would be a ready local market for the heavy crude it produced Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a lot narrower today Osborne said Chevron operates the block on behalf of 16 companies which include British Petroleum Development Ltd DSM Hydrocarbons (UK) Ltd Enterprise Oil (TNS) Ltd Marathon Int Pet (GB) Ltd and Phillips Petroleum Co UK Ltd cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates Faber Plc <WIFLL> chairman and chief executive David Palmer said the company would consider any bid for its 208 pct shareholding in Morgan

Vintners said The acquisition is an excellent one both commercially and financially Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the Government was going ahead with this month's flotation of British Petroleum Co Plc <BPL> shares despite the collapse on international stock markets We are going ahead because the whole issue has been underwritten - we had it underwritten because there is always a risk of this sort of thing happening Lawson said in a BBC radio interview Lawson's remarks came as renewed selling on the London stock market took BP shares down a further 33p to 283 well below the 330p price set for the around seven billion stg issue Lawson said the UK Economy is fundamentally sound and added that stock markets had reflected that recently I profoundly believe in the market system as the best way for securing economic prosperity (but) that does not mean to say the markets are infallible My advice to small investorsIs to remain calm There is absolutely no reason not to do so Lawson said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the severity of the current rout on world stock markets was an absurd over-reaction sparked on Wall Street by a spreading lack of confidence in the US Economy Lawson said in a BBC radio interview This began on Wall Street It has a lot to do with the American stock market (and) a lack of confidence in the US - and some careless talk by those who should have known better In a further wave of selling this morning in London the FTSE 100 index had lost a further 2332 points only 50 minutes after the official 0800 GMT opening to stand at 18191 Lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to have been expected after the bull markets of recent years What was not expected was the severity of the downturn which quite frankly is rather absurd He said he saw no fundamental signs why the US Economy should go into recession adding Indeed the possibility of higher (US) interest rates would certainly in my judgment not lead the American economy into a recession The only way in which the American economy would go into recession was if it actually talks itself into recession he said firm EF Hutton Group Inc <EFH> is not facing liquidity problems as a result of the fall on Wall Street nor is the firm on the brink of insolvency London joint managing director Harry Romney said He was replying to questions about

cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets London economists said There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett If not there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar the Fed will be forced to tighten This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the US With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world But some economists added that Wall Street's crash which dragged other major markets down with it may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent US Trade deficits If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the US They say Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates he added Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 925 pct Tuesday and US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy via a banking crisis for example thus precipitating recession It also helped the dollar rally sharply to a high of 18200 marks from a European low of 17880 But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind The United States has been able to live on borrowed time If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recessionIt contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the US Economy said Capel's Dennis But he added that markets are still very much in danger The liquidity doesn't disappearAll it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets Dennis noted David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad said Morrison The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong he said unexpectedly heavy 44 billion stg surge in UK September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state economists said An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure noted Peter Spencer UK Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data which compared won stg August rise UK Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities Equity markets dropped sharply on the news touching a day's low of 17667 on the FTSE 100 index after the data before staging a recovery Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout UK Money market rates in a similarly calm response resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct With the financial markets doing what they're doing that's the last thing the Bank of England would want to do Spencer said The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm the authorities are unlikely to put rates up said Kevin Boakes chief UK Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 52 pct year-on-year from August's 45 pct growth which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury But The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign noted Paul Temperton UK Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 195 pct in September from August's 22 pct It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in UK Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 49 billion stg July rise in bank lending Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of UK Asset markets Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour he said In the light of the precipitous falls on UK Equity markets in the past few days There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales Temperton said Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues he added I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the pastWe are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality Spencer said A UK Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information not just the bank lending adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by UK Clearing banks rose by 166 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments Finance Minister Michael Wilson says the leading industrial nations have held a number of discussions on providing liquidity to the financial system after Monday's record stock market decline There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada the United States Japan Britain West Germany France and Italy) he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer interest rates have been dropping Wilson said The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries Wilson said This has been going on during the course of yesterday through the evening and this morning and this will continue he said What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economieslooks good Wilson said Irish Banks Plc <ALBKL> said it plans to open a Tokyo office Initially it will be a representative office but the company said it hopes to have a full banking licence

Council (ITC) can appeal over the use of ITC documents in court actions On November 2 the House of Lords will decide if and to what extent ITC documents whether circulated or not are admissible as court evidence Lawyers working in the legal tangle left from the October 1985 collapse of the tin market said this hearing is likely to last a few days On Wednesday the Court of Appeal will link the outstanding ITC cases that have so far reached it and a single set of hearings could begin in early January they added The House of Lords ruling on the use of ITC documents will be referred back to the action by two Shearson Lehman companies against the London Metal Exchange although the underlying case is not expected to be resumed until mid-1988 The Court of Appeal hearings include action between brokers and cases by brokers and banks against the ITC and the member governments of the tin council Action taken by brokers seeking both the winding up of the ITC or and placing it into receivership will also be covered by the Court of Appeal legal schedule American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962 he said The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free in an effort to fill its oilseed needs But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax The subsidies are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes US Farmers mad as hell Adams said The ASA is confident the US Congress will support its trade complaint Adams said The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC which will be considered by the EC Commission in December US Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982 primarily as a result of EC policies Adams added Lord Plumb European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the US Halted overseas sales of soy products United States is prepared to pull out all the stops to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) US Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community's (EC) agricultural support policies he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee The US claims the EC directive due to come into effect on January 1 threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of US meat shipments into the EC The US also will oppose all EC efforts to impair US trade via the EC oilseeds regime which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax Samuels said Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected Samuels said Samuels called the US plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000 proposed at GATT in July visionary and very serious The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes dairy and sugar It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies The US Is not opposed to short-term measures as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions Samuels said Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access the US Ambassador said The US can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the US plan when it tables its own proposal he added The key difference between the two approaches is that the US wants farm subsidies eliminated while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports Samuels said If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation he added Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the US wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT International Coffee Organization (ICO) Executive Board is to hold a meeting on November 3/4 its first since export quotas were re-introduced early this month An ICO

said it has no intention of making a full bid for the company and would not contemplate doing so over the next six months in the absence of a material change in the circumstances of Ranks RHM said it regards the stake build-up as a hostile move which is unwelcome and not in the long term interest of shareholders Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the recent dispute between the United States and West Germany over economic policy was responsible for much financial turmoil and that it should never have happened He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important between finance ministers of the major nations He said the dispute was a row which should not have happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with US Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised West Germany for having raised its key interest rates Aerospace Plc <BAELL> has won a 150 mln stg contract to supply Switzerland with military equipment including 20 Hawk Mk 66 advanced jet trainers The training and logistic package includes a <Rediffusion Plc> Hawk flight simulator a BAe spokesman said The first plane will be made in Britain and delivered to Switzerland by late 1989 The remaining 19 aircraft will be co-produced by BAe and Swiss industry with final assembly in Emmen the spokesman said The Hawks will enter service in 1990 replacing the Swiss Air Force's British De Havilland Vampire jets Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the collapse of British share prices this week held no implication so far for domestic interest rates He said in a television interview that there is nothing in the events of the past few days to increase the upward pressure on (UK) interest rates Sterling has so far stayed solid during the crisis backed by strong economic fundamentals and by 10 pct bank base lending rates analysts said Lawson's comments followed another frantic day in London's financial center where British shares closed 122 pct down on the day Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said there is more confidence in British financial institutions than in US Equivalents so there is no need for an official statement that the Bank of England will provide liquidity to the UK Financial system Our institutions are in a stronger position I think and the state of confidence is very much higher in this country so I see no need for the Bank of EnglandTo make any statement of that kind he said in an interview on Channel Four television Earlier a pledge to provide such liquidity from US Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan reassured world markets Lawson said the Bank of England also saw no reason to provide such reassurance The Bank of England had earlier declined comment Analysts said Greenspan's pledge that the Fed would stand behind the US Financial system reassured markets that the current turmoil should not spill over into the rest of the economy through a crisis in a financial institution caught out by heavy equity price losses and bond price volatility Community (EC) agriculture ministers gave their support in principle for a new scheme to limit spending on the bloc's controversial farm policy at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday Danish minister Laurits Tornaes told journalists Acceptance of the scheme by which farmers would suffer price cuts if their production exceeded certain norms known in EC jargon as stabilisers is seen by diplomats as vital if the EC is to solve its current massive budget crisis Speaking at a news conference after chairing a two-day meeting of farm ministers Tornaes said: It is no longer a question of whether we are to have stabilisers It is now a question of how we are to implement them However EC sources warned that despite Tornaes' optimism it may be difficult to get the sort of detailed agreement needed on the stabiliser scheme ahead of an EC heads of government meeting in Copenhagen on December 6 This is the vital meeting at which EC leaders will be asked to agree a new system of EC financing ending the bloc's hand-to-mouth existence which has resulted in its being unable to agree a budget for 1988 Britain has said it will block moves to give the EC additional sources of finance unless a detailed system of stabilisers is agreed at or ahead of the summit Under the most important stabiliser scheme EC guaranteed prices for cereals would be cut by one percentage point for every per cent by which the annual harvest exceeded 155 mln tonnes a figure well below what EC farmers are capable of producing in a year of favourable weather conditions Farm ministers will meet again on November 16 to attempt to hammer out an accord and Danish diplomatic sources said the meeting could last through several long nights of negotiation But Tornaes said any thought that success was not ultimately possible would be a gesture of retreat at this stage EC Commission sources said among the remaining problems were appeals from Southern member states for protection for their small and relatively poor farmers and calls from France and the Netherlands for significant changes to Commission proposals for arable crops They added that West Germany appears still reluctant to accept the idea of production ceilings being set at the level of the EC as a whole rather than that of member states Meanwhile the ministers made little progress in agreeing a scheme to top up the income of poorer farmers through direct payments which could help to cushion the impact of stabilisers on them British minister John MacGregor told journalists :The proposals as they stand have very few friends He said a number of countries fear they could simply encourage further unwanted production by giving farmers the cash to improve production methods Manhattan Corp (CMB) president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic conditions If we are right about the fundamentals this thing should settle down Labrecque said at a news conference at the American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause US monetary officials to ease credit policies Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year Labrecque said He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to continue well into 1988 I don't think the stock market will cause a recession Labrecque said He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from the stock market fall would be Chase's stock price however dropped 23 pct but other money center banks suffered even sharper losses Referring to the banking industry he said: We're talking about one day These are strong institutions he said Labrecque said he did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary policy in view of the stock market's behavior If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the other way he said Labrecque said the high US budget deficit was not the single most important factor behind the market's worries He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the United States West Germany Japan and Britain foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe told his EC colleagues on Monday that Britain wants agreement by December on a detailed plan to curb EC farm spending if it is to sanction an increase in EC budgetary resources British diplomatic sources quoted Howe as saying that an accord containing detailed figures and involving immediate penalties for farmers in the case of overproduction must be reached in advance of an EC heads of government summit meeting in December We require numbers as well as words in all the commodity regimes Howe was quoted as saying The EC Commission proposed last month a plan for budgetary stabilisers under which there would be reductions in guaranteed prices restrictions of sales into intervention or increases in coresponsibility levies if output of individual commodities exceeded certain levels Britain has so far given the clearest backing to the idea although several other EC states back it in outline Diplomats say Britain can exercise some leverage on the issue because the EC is in a severe budgetary crisis from which it can only emerge if all 12 member states agree to revise the system by which it is financed The sources quoted Howe as saying: An interim or partial solution covering some elements of the Commission package would be unacceptable to the United Kingdom They said he insisted that any penalties imposed on farmers for exceeding production limits must take effect in the same marketing year as the overproduction rather than resulting in a price adjustment the following year Howe also said there should be no question of a special fund which could top up EC farm coffers in the event of an unexpected development such as a major fall in the value of the dollar The Commission has suggested such a fund to deal with emergency situations French EC affairs minister Bernard Bosson told journalists that his country could not accept the idea that there should be no emergency reserve The British position has become tougher he said Howe was speaking at a meeting of EC foreign ministers which discussed the future of EC finances and which took place simultaneously with a farm ministers' meeting to consider the Commission's farm spending proposals Before his meeting got under way British agriculture minister John MacGregor said he backed the Commission proposal to set the 1988 cereals production ceiling at 155 mln tonnes Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson welcomed on Monday the reaffirmation by the US And West Germany of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilising currencies His office said Lawson had welcomed the outcome of a meeting between US Treasury Secretary James Baker Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg in Frankfurt After the meeting a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing key interest rates saying they were not in line with last February's Louvre accord and Western Inc's publishing unit Simon and Schuster said it agreed in principle to acquire <Woodhead-Faulkner (Publishers) Ltd> a British-based publisher of professional and consumer books for undisclosed terms Upon completion of the proposed transaction Woodhead-Faulkner will become part of Simon and Schuster's International Group which in the UK includes Simon and Schuster trade books and Prentice Hall academic texts Simon and Schuster said that Woodhead-Faulkner will continue to publish under that name The company will continue to be under the direction of Martin Woodhead who will report to Henry Hirschberg president of Simon and Schuster's International Group Woodhead-Faulkner founded in 1972 publishes international banking finance and investment books European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year an EC commission spokesman said He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on US Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones the spokesman said Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming US Manufacturers It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France Britain West Germany and Spain the countries involved in the Airbus project state oil company Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap (Statoil) signed contracts worth a total of 15 billion Norwegian crowns in connection with the development of the Veslefrikk oil field Statoil said Moss Rosenberg Verft of Stavanger has been awarded a contract to convert the the drilling platform West Vision to a floating production platform The work is to be completed in the summer of 1989 Aker Verdal has been awarded a contract for the engineering purchasing and construction of the steel jacket for the wellhead platform also to be completed in 1989 Statoil said British Treasury confirmed that the sale of British Petroleum Co Plc will go ahead as planned despite Monday's stock market crash which forced BP below the 330p a share set for the 72 billion stg issue The government are not considering terminating the BP offer The offer has been fully underwritten a Treasury spokesman said The issue which remains open until October 28 was fully underwritten last week when the issue price was set BP shares closed down 33p at 317p as the FT-SE 100 share index crashed a record 2496 points more than 10 pct property firm <Renta Inmobiliaria SA>

limit and then reverse oil price gains that followed the US Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf earlier on Monday analysts said December loading rose to 1965 dlrs up 45 cents before falling to around 1905/15 later unchanged from last Friday Fundamentals are awful said Philip Lambert analyst with stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson adding that total OPEC production in the first week of October could be above 185 mln bpd little changed from September levels Peter Nicol analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank said OPEC production could be about 185-190 mln in October and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 185 mln bpd The US Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the US Flag the Sea Isle City It was struck by a missile believed to be Iranian in Kuwaiti waters and was the first hit on a US Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war The US Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday also believed struck by an Iranian missile Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the US Attack analysts said They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz through which around eight mln bpd passes isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the US Or Iran they said Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities analysts said But they saw the US Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks with some describing it as responsible Geoffrey Pyne analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew said he was impressed by the sensible US Response The US Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response Today's action by the US Was not escalatory Pyne said Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the US Strike was a responsible retaliation with the US Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view however He said he was unable to see what the US Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia whose interests the US Is supposedly defending will feel less secure as a result of the US Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a US Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw Peninsula close to Kuwait analysts said The later downtrend followed confirmation of a US Navy attack on an Iranian oil platform by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinburger Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact and finding it less serious than first thought took profits taking prices lower analysts and traders said Swiss Banking Commission hopes to introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual liquidity requirements Commission Director Kurt Hauri told the main consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in interest rates which occurs at the end of every month By effectively reducing liquidity requirements it would also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain West Germany and the United States he said The commission wants to move to a system of average liquidity requirements where banks have to hold reserves equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated over the month as a whole The current system described as a Swiss special case by Hauri forces banks to comply with requirements generally only at the end of each month The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money market rates overshadowed by the approach of the end-month called the ultimo with consequent high costs for the banks who are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when overnight rates hit triple figures due to a combination of the half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its money supply target Although the rise shocked the bank into more flexibility the problem remained The reform proposal which Hauri said had been planned for years was given to banks and other interested parties for comment on September 30 They have until the end of this month to suggest alterations Subject to such changes and to the government go-ahead it will come into force on January 1 Hauri said has opened export registrations for November coffee

also is supported by a multiple option facility arranged in the Euromarkets in August Sugar Plc was forced to shut its Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute shortage of beet supplies a spokesman said responding to a inquiry Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination of very wet weather which has prevented most farmers in the factory's catchment area from harvesting and last week's hurricane which blocked roads The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are cleared and supplies of beet build up again This is the first time in many years that a factory has been closed in mid-campaign the spokesman added Other factories are continuing to process beet normally but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British Sugar It processes in excess of 500000 tonnes of beet a year out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting problems in other factory areas British Sugar is maintaining its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 12 mln tonnes white value against 134 mln last year the spokesman said British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the UK The sugar beet processing campaign which began last month is expected to run until the end of January Sugar factories normally work 24 hours a day seven days a week during the campaign As of October 11 12 pct of the UK Sugar crop had been harvested little different to the same stage last year when 13 pct had been lifted Since then however very wet weather has severely restricted beet lifting Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet available Brothers Inc> is not withdrawing as a market maker in euroyen bonds contrary to strong market rumours circulating in London a London-based spokeswoman for the company's New York headquarters said Earlier a spokesman for Salomon Brothers' London operations declined to comment at all on rumours that have been circulating here Euroyen bond traders had said they were informally contacted by their counterparts at Salomon and told that they would no longer be market makers in those securities The traders said that Salomon had not notified the Association of International Bond Dealers (AIBD) of its plans to withdraw as a market maker Under new rules recently adopted by the AIBD notification would be required if the firm decided it no longer wished to make two-way prices at all times in euroyen bonds According to dealers at several Japanese banks Salomon's euroyen bond traders have been in a meeting and unavailable to make prices Market sources said that Salomon had offered the traders a chance to remain with the firm if they were willing to trade eurobonds denominated in other currencies Dealers noted that at one point this year euroyen bond issuance had actually outpaced that of eurodollar denominated bonds the first time the US Unit has been eclipsed as the currency of choice for international borrowers Dealers said that given the dollar's recent weakness the yen could once again top the eurobond issuance tables Last week Salomon Brothers

industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added

July 31 Record July 3 House today supported a call for Japan to boost its defense spending to help share the burden of protecting Western interests in sensitive areas around the world including in the Gulf House member approved a measure that would require Secretary of State George Shultz to enter into talks with Japan on increasing Japanese defense spending to at least 3 pct of its gross national product The measure passed during consideration of the 1988-89 State Department funding bill would not require an increase but legislators called on Japan to spend more on defense The Senate must approve the measure before it becomes law We don't have to bash the Japanese We have to show them how to share the burden of the defense of the free world said Rep Robert Dornan a California Republican The amendment calls on Shultz to enter into talks with Japan with the aim of reaching agreement on one of two alternatives: either Japan can spend 3 pct of its GNP on defense by itself or

Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major majority holder in Cetus Fildes told in an interview Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind of arrangement said Fildes Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments by Fildes Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only one to own an equity position in Cetus Eastman Kodak Co <EK> and WR Grace <WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus but neither owns an equity position in the company said Fildes Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic products and with Grace to develop agricultural products Earlier Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop new biotechnology products in several fields As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus' anticancer agents including interleukin-2 in development Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but not in North American and Western Europe We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in North America and Europe said Fildes He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its own in that market Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own business Many large corporations have invested in small biotech firms But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made in biotechnology Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship with a large number of other biotechnology companies Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug areas like diagnostics and agriculture but to keep the biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas as the cardiovascular anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory markets Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research over the next five years Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and development to make it happen while the equity position part of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this partnership said Fildes National Broadcasting Co a unit of General Electric

honour its contract with International according to Florida's Department of Insurance which had filed a petition on the matter As previously reported International the largest health maintenance organisation in Florida was declared insolvent on May 14 Federal regulators had also told the company its Medicare contract would be terminated on July 31 because of the company's financial and management problems Michelle McLawhorn Florida Department spokeswoman said International's insurer State Mutual Life Assurance Co of America had made clear it would fight activation of the policy because International did not provide it with accurate financial records State Mutual could not be reached for comment McLawhorn said it was not yet known how many creditors International had or how big its debt was The court gave State Mutual 20 days to show why it should not be obliged to pay claims against the solvency policy US Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course economists said But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy A survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8 with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion Instead M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 7457 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate Coming on the heels of a 43 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1 this means the nation's money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks economists said M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates M-2 and M-3 which are seen as better gauges of economic growth Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges If money growth does not accelerate Fed officials concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging could turn toward easier monetary policy economists said Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No Sullivan said But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed's reserve projections the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached A drop in May US Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the US Economy are lagging while a recent modest 03 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears Slifer said If this continues we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point he said Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the economy one said I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar If it does then this gives them more room to ease he said profit six cents vs loss 10 Net profit 81 mln dlrs vs loss 71

on increased exports to the US For growth Given the importance of exports particularly export manufactures to all of your countries you are going to have to work hard to diversify your markets he said While you may be able to maintain your current market share in the US You clearly will not be able to look to the US To take major increases in your exports he added Shultz told the foreign ministers of Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore and Thailand the US Would cut its huge foreign trade deficit more rapidly than many now believed He said ASEAN's looming trade problems would not necessarily stem from protectionist legislation now being contemplated by Congress but simply because of the adjustments the US Economy will have to make in order to service our large and growing external debt Shultz said the US Deficit had resulted not from falling exports but from higher imports that had fuelled world growth and Co Ltd <MITST> paid 15 mln dlrs in early May for a five pct

founded in 1981 and now has about 100 employees he said US Officials are looking to Japan for help in buttressing the world economy in the event of an American recession next year Japanese government sources said During a visit to the US Earlier this month Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo was asked by both US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and Council of Economic Advisers chairman Beryl Sprinkel what Japan could do if the US Enters recession next year Although Sprinkel indicated that he personally did not expect a recession next year Volcker seemed to acknowledge that an economic downturn was at least a possibility the sources said Faced with with a huge budget deficit the US Has little room to manoeuvre on fiscal policy to counteract any downturn that might occur in 1988 It is also hamstrung as far as monetary policy is concerned because US Inflation is already showing some signs of picking up one source said But Japan is also limited in what action it could take to help counteract a US Recession without running the risk of overstimulating its domestic economy and pushing up inflation the sources said Money supply growth is accelerating and interest rates are at record low levels In May M-2 money supply plus certificates of deposit grew at a year-on-year rate of 102 pct well above nominal GNP growth of four to five pct Some government sources are also worried that the recently announced 6000 billion yen emergency economic package could push up land prices and the construction sector's inflation Public investment spending grew at a year-on-year rate of about 10 pct in April but that could accelerate to 20 pct later this year under the impact of the emergency package one source said The 6000 billion yen package was generally well received in the US Although US Congressmen and businessmen told Kondo they wanted the measures implemented quickly sources said The Japanese minister explained that the acceleration of public works spending in the package was taking place immediately they said US Congressmen were particularly interested in how much impact the package would have on reducing the bilateral trade imbalance a question which Kondo was unable to answer clearly given the many economic uncertainties involved the sources said While recognizing that Japan's trade surplus is falling in terms of volume some Congressmen expressed concern that it was not falling fast enough But the sources said no one pressed Kondo for a further rise of the yen as a solution to correcting the bilateral trade imbalance joint committee of

method for producing transistors by creating an entirely new electronic material The new method they said consists of simultaneously growing metal connections and silicon crystals together to form one three dimensional device with connections penetrating the entire device Conventional transistors require many steps to make and have connections only on the surface GTE Laboratories created an entirely new electronic material and device form which may open up a spectrum of uses that cannot even be imagined at this time said David Decker vice president and director of research for GTE Laboratories Although still early in our research we are obviously excited that we have found a significantly simpler and we believe cheaper way to produce an electronic device he said Researchers at GTE created the new transistor by combining and heating silicon and a conductive metal tantalum disilicide so that the two grow together The resulting device has microscopic metal rods extending througout the chips creating a three dimensional transistor that should be superior to standard devics in high power applications the scientists said They said that because the connections extend vertically througout the new device it has a much greater volume of active material than conventional surface-mounted connections Decker said the scientists are still in the early stages of their research on the device but prototypes of the new device compare favorably with conventionaly made transistors and show promise of superior performance He said the prototype device also proved to be particularly efficient in detecting light which could open up new possibilities in solar energy conversion the development of electronic cameras and greater efficiency in optical communication systems

project The bank said two loans will support Jamaica's structural adjustment program -- a 40 mln dlr loan for trade and financial sector adjustment and a 20 mln dlr loan for the public enterprise sector The 40 mln dlr loan is designed to raise the performance of exports and industry and strengthen the financial sector Governor James Thompson will likely sign a bill setting December 1 1990 as the trigger date opening the state to wider interstate banking a gubernatorial spokesman said The bill passed both chambers of the Illinois legislature this week by wide margins The bill provides that Illinois banks and bank holding companies can be acquired by similar institutions from any state with a reciprocal law Current Illinois law limits interstate banking to six Midwestern states The governor had supported a July 1 1988 date for full interstate banking Large banking firms particularly Citicorp <CCI> have lobbied for the earlier date But legislation with the later date was approved in the state's house and senate The governor has the authority to use an amendatory veto and pencil in an earlier trigger date I'm sure the bill will get his approval the spokesman said The only question is whether he will use his authority to change the trigger date He will hear from people who want the different dates I don't think he'll take action before late summer World Bank said it approved loans to Jamaica totalling 104 mln dlrs to assist it with an economic structural adjustment program a sugar industry rehabilitation scheme and a population and health project The bank said two loans will support Jamaica's structural adjustment program -- a 40 mln dlr loan for the trade and financial sector and a 20 mln dlr loan for the public enterprise sector The bank said a 34 mln dlr loan is to help Jamaica's sugar industry become self-sufficient and meet both domestic demand and the export demand of the United States and European Community The fourth loan for 10 mln dlrs is to

Adams and Peck Inc for 15 dlrs a share in cash for all its outstanding shares The proposal which expires July 1 values Stifel at about 54 mln dlrs Stifel has about 36 mln shares outstanding The company said its management and board of directors will consider the proposal but have not set a date to meet It said the proposal is currently being studied by Goldman Sachs and Co and legal counsel It said conditions of the proposal include obtaining necessary financing satisfactory completion of a due diligence investigation by Laidlaw and execution of employment contracts with key employees to be designated by Laidlaw crude oil prices are at their highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC meeting even though most industry analysts do not expect any policy changes from the session They said prices which have steadily climbed since the organization's accord in December have risen on technical factors within the market and concerns about supplies because of the Iran-Iraq war which could disrupt deliveries from the Gulf The US benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading around 2055 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market That is its highest level since January 1986 OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman who is Nigeria's oil minister said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production agreement may only need a slight review Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation of the December agreement oil prices continue to climb due to a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon after the OPEC meeting At that point barring any increased tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies prices should begin easing OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed to in December because oil prices are firm said John Hill a vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at 18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to 166 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 183 mln barrels in the fourth quarter This agreement helped send prices sharply higher rising from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December Several OPEC members who are price hawks including Iran Algeria and Libya will seek a higher official price and a reduction in output And if US West Texas Intermediate crude continues to trade above 20 dlrs a barrel there is a greater chance that OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price said Nauman Barakat analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co But most analysts expect the more moderate producers such as Saudi Arabia to block any changes in policy The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the official prices because OPEC and in particular the Saudis are committed to stabilizing the market said Rosario Ilacqua analyst with LF Rothschild However some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting in September to re-evaluate market conditions Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 183 mln barrels a day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500000 barrels to the market each day said John Lichtblau president of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to offset the decline in the dollar Oil prices are denominated throughout the world in dollars so as the currency declines producers receive less money for their oil The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia said Sanford Margoshes analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to produce at their 41 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting he said One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian Gulf said Frank Knuettel analyst with Prudential-Bache Securites Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been regular targets for Iranian planes The Reagan administration is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the US flag with naval escorts Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis like this and just general nervousness over an incident that could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up Knuettel said New York Times Co said it had an agreement to buy the Gwinnett Daily News an evening newspaper published in Lawrenceville Ga Terms were not disclosed The company said Gwinnett has a weekday circulation of about 27500 and a Sunday circulation of about 30900 The New York Times also said Gwinnett County a northeast suburb of Atlanta is the fastest-growing county in the country The purchase agreement includes the Forsyth County News published on Wednesday and Sunday and the Winder News a weekly among other publications Corp said its board declared a special dividend of 17 cts per share payable Aug 14 1987 to shareholders of record July 31 1987 The company said it is not its intention to pay quarterly dividends but from time to time pays special dividends if the board believes it appropriate tug-of-war over who pays to develop new weapons--contractors or the government--is likely to lead to more writeoffs by defense firms analysts said Singer Co <SMF> and Northrop Corp <NOC> recently announced planned second quarter writeoffs related to costs of major defense programs under fixed-price government contracts It's a case of companies paying for things that in a different environment the Defense Department would have paid for said Howard Mager of Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp In recent years the Defense Department DOD has increased competitive bidding for weapons contracts and has asked contractors to pay more of the costs of developing weapons programs The moves have helped cut waste and abuse by contractors but have also dictated that the firms assume much more risk analysts said It's a stricter environment said Anthony Hatch of Argus Research Corp Contractors are absorbing more of the cost and more of risk and that's likely to be the trend for some time to come The trend will probably lead to further writeoffs the analysts said Programs most prone they agreed are the Advanced Tactical Fighter ATF a new generation high-technology fighter plane being developed for the US Air Force the C-17 air transport plane and the Light Helicopter Experimental LHX under development for the Army Other programs may also be affected they said The Air Force is expected to order 750 of the advanced fighter planes in the 1990s at a cost of up to 40 billion dlrs analysts have said Two teams of contractors are competing for a contract to develop a prototype ATF Lockheed Corp <LK> General Dynamics Corp <GD> and Boeing Co <BA> are teamed in competition against Northrop Corp <NOC> and McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD> on ATF The two teams fighting for an award to develop the LHX are Bell Helicopter a unit of Textron Inc <TXT> coupled with McDonnell Douglas and United Technologies Corp's <UTX> Sikorsky paired with Boeing The C-17 is a four-engine transport plane McDonnell Douglas's Douglas Aircraft Co is working on two test planes and a production award for up to 210 of the aircraft should be made by late 1989 a Douglas Aircraft spokesman said Under the government's new procedures contractors can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on development and typically recoup their investments during production But now the government sometimes awards production to a second contractor who did not develop the system General Electric Co <GE> for example developed the F404 engine for the Navy But two weeks ago the Pentagon awarded 30 pct of F404 production to United Technologies' Pratt and Whitney Such tactics have increased competition but the government now risks decimating the industry by making it too competitive said Michael LaTronica of Redding Research Group Two years ago defense contractors were their own worst enemies They were not cost efficient LaTronica said Now DOD has allowed the situation to swing so far back the other way that you may be in danger of losing the defense industry as a national resource While the nation as a whole has posted trade deficits in recent years aerospace and defense has exported more products than it imported he noted LaTronica and others said however that changes in government procurement may be coming I hear that the Pentagon is looking into the situation said John Diamantis defense analyst at Pershing and Co He said that some small defense electronics firms believe the Pentagon will begin re-evaluating procurement policy and perhaps start paying more development money Redding Research's LaTronica who still likes the industry despite the probability of additional unforeseen writeoffs said There's been a swing in sentiment The defense bashing psychology of the last few years is starting to shift LaTronica noted that one government official has recently suggested that the winner of the ATF prototype award should get sole production of the plane for a specified time The investments are large The Lockheed General Dynamics Boeing ATF team for example is spending 691 mln dlrs just to develop the prototype The danger the Pentagon runs if changes are not made is that companies will hesitate to bid to develop a program but instead will wait for a second source production award But it may take a company going bust to really change people's thinking LaTronica said Corp said it told the US Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed combustion technology a method for the more efficient burning of solids at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado due to high costs Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct US Synthetic Fuels Corp Unocal said it would study using the technology at the oil shale plant In return the company would have been eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports from the US Treasury Department which took over the contract from the Synthetic Fuels Corp Unocal said Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and electricity for the oil shale project Unocal said Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project uneconomical even with government price supports and loan guarantees Unocal said The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4000 to 5000 barrels per day of crude shale oil Unocal said Co <MRK> and Squibb Corp <SQB> will benefit from a study that shows lower levels of blood cholesterol slows the build-up of fat in the heart's arteries lowering the risk of heart attacks industry analysts said Both companies have developed drugs that slow the body's production of cholesterol although Merck is about 18 months ahead of Squibb with a drug expected to be approved this year Certainly this study will create greater acceptance of anti-cholesterol drugs said Robert Uhl a drug analyst at F Eberstadt Fleming Although neither company's drug was used in the study which was conducted by a team of scientists at the University of Southern California School of Medicine both are leaders in a new class of drugs that fight cholesterol The study reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed lower levels of cholesterol achieved through a combination of drugs and special diet slowed and in some cases reversed the build up of fatty deposits in the heart's arteries Such build up leads to heart attacks the leading cause of death in the US Health officials have said lower levels of cholesterol could immediately benefit six mln Americans who suffer symptoms of coronary artery disease The study advocated reduction of cholesterol in some 40 mln Americans As the anti-cholesterol crusade gains momentum industry analysts and executives believe a healthier diet and drug therapy will gain wider acceptance In this context pharmaceutical analyst David Crossen of Sanford C Bernstein said the culture can shift in terms of drug treatment because some people arn't going to fundamentally alter their diets The worldwide anti-cholesterol drug market is valued at 600 mln dlrs a year But as the new drugs reach the market analysts estimate revenues will swell to 15 billion dlrs annually in about next five years The drugs used in the study in combination with the low cholesterol diet were niacin a common compound and colestipol a drug Upjohn Co <UPJ> has sold since 1977 But these two drugs have some drawbacks that analysts say the new drugs from Merck and Squibb avoid Niacin leads to tremendous amounts of flushing constipation or stomach upset Crossen said Colestipol a sand-like powder comes in a dosage of 15 to 30 grams and must be mixed with a glass of water It isn't fun to take Crossen said Drug analyst Uhl said the drawbacks restricted Upjohn's sales for the drug which he said is under 10 mln dlrs a year In contrast the new drugs from Merck and Squibb have little side effects because they target a key factor in the body's production of cholesterol -- an enzyme found in the liver Past methods of getting down cholesterol have been rather variable said Dr Charles Sanders an executive vice president at Squibb The new drugs in contrast interupt a clear step in cholesterol production Sanders said Also the new drugs are easier to take since they come in a tablet form swallowed once or twice a day Merck's drug Mevacor received a recommendation from an advisory panel of the Food and Drug Administration earlier this year and is expected to receive full approval for sale in late summer or fall Squibb's drug eptastatin is expected to be submitted for regulatory approval in the first or second quarter 1988 Sanders said Warner Lambert Co <WLA> and Bristol Meyers Co <BMY> also have cholesterol fighting compounds similar to the Upjohn drug but only Merck and Upjohn are ahead in the new class of cholesterol inhibitors Crow Co said it agreed to buy the 42-story headquarters building of First Wisconsin Corp for undisclosed terms The privately held real estate development and investment firm said it plans to develop the remainder of the eight-acre site in Milwaukee to include a tower with office space luxury condominiums and retail stores First

Chaparral provides regularly scheduled service out of Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport as an affiliated carrier of AMR Corp <AMR> and had revenues in 1986 of 141 mln dlrs International Inc said executive vice president and chief operating officer Kurt K Bushati will leave September One to accept a senior operating position with the Austrian national oil company The company said president and chief executive officer Eugene L Butler will assume the added duties of chief operating officer and Phelps said it lowered its ratings on senior debt and preferred stock to DP-7 (low A) from DP-6 (high A) affecting nearly 670 mln dlrs in debt securities The action reflects the increased financial leverage resulting from the company's 1986 acquisition of Hammmermill Paper which raised the fixed obligations ratio to 34 pct compared with 26 pct in 1985 Duff and Phelps said and Poor's Corp said it is keeping Crazy Eddie Inc's 81 mln dlrs of B-rated convertible subordinated debt on creditwatch with negatives implications The company's implied senior debt rating is BB-minus S and P said it considers a downgrade of Crazy Eddie more likely because of a rash of senior management resignations and Chemical Bank's withdrawal of a 52 mln dlr credit line Crazy Eddie has yet to respond to two competing takeover bids one by founder and chairman Eddie Antar with First City Capital Corp and a second for about 235 mln dlrs by Entertainment Marketing Inc S and P noted Hanover Corp is offering 200 mln dlrs of two-year senior extendable notes with a final maturity of 1993 yielding 830 pct said lead manager Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc The notes have an 8-1/4 pct coupon and were priced at 9990 to yield 85 basis points more than the when-issued two-year Treasury note After two years holders can sell the notes back to Manufacturers at par In 1989 and every year until 1993 the issuer will conduct an open reset on the yields of those notes not sold back to it Shearson said Moody's Investors

cited a leveraged buyout offer from an investor group that was organized by Citibank and included management The buyout of Leaseway will result in significant deterioration of its balance sheet the agency pointed out Leaseway's strong competitive position in auto hauling and retail support services will enable it to generate sufficient cash flow to service commitments But S and P expects debt

alternative supplies to replace the spot natural gas that Transco Energy Co <E> no longer delivers a company official told Edward Sondey vice president of supply said that under a grandfather clause Brooklyn Union could request Transco to transmit 165 mln cubic feet (mcf) a day of spot natural gas after purchasing 250 mcf of contract gas from Transco Brooklyn Union has been taking only 30 pct or 75 mcf of the contract gas from Transco and acquiring about 120 mcf on the spot or non-contract market he said Lacking access to spot gas through Transco would not cost Brooklyn Union more than 50 cts per mln btu for now Sondey said as Transco contract gas costs 255 dlrs per mln compared to about two dlrs for spot gas The rate increase will not be serious Sondey said The contract price at 255 dlrs per mln BTU has been effective since May 1 after Transco lowered its commodity rate to reflect seasonal weakness making it the lowest in the 12 months ended May 31 according to report submitted by Brooklyn Union to New York Public Utility Commission In peak demand season Transco's contract gas reached as high as 430 to 440 dlrs per mln btu a commission official said Industry analysts expected

insider trading and would recommend language for such a definition within six weeks Acting SEC chairman Charles Cox told the Senate Banking Committee a bill proposed this week to define insider trading as the wrongful use of material nonpublic information was good but contained some ambiguous provisions which might reduce the Commission's flexibility in prosecuting cases The Commission believes a definition of insider trading is desirable Cox said He promised to provide the SEC's recommended definition to the committee by August 3 The bill proposed by Sens Donald Riegle a Michigan Democrat and Alfonse D'Amato a New York Republican would make it illegal for anyone to receive or pass on inside information even if the person providing the information did not use it to make a securities transaction Federal law enforcement officials have said a definition of insider trading would be useful because it is a difficult crime to prove Cox said the SEC was having success in its insider trading cases despite the lack of a clear definition He became acting chairman of the agency when chairman John Shad left to become US Ambassador to the Netherlands President Reagan nominated Northwestern University law professor David Ruder as SEC chairman on Wednesday but he may not be confirmed by the Senate for several weeks Riegle the chairman of the Senate securities subcommittee said he wanted to act on the legislation this year but Thomas Moore a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisors said action should be delayed until the Supreme Court ruled on the appearl of an insider trading conviction by former Wall Street Journal reporter R Foster Winans Winans was convicted for telling a friend in advance what stocks he was going to write about in his column The stocks usually went up or down in price depending on Winans' recommendation We believe it would be better to wait until the Supreme Court has reviewed the Winans case before any leigilation is considered After the court decides this case we can better consider how the law might be changed Until that time legislation is premature Moore said in his testimony shr two cts vs three cts Oper net

opposed trade legislation pending in Congress saying it would curb their exports slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt Mario Rodriguez Montero president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist

official responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on coffee quotas are still uncertain despite recent Colombian efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers Jon Rosenbaum an assistant US trade representative just back from trade talks in Colombia said most producing countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas There is one country which evidently still does not Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil which has been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical discussions with Colombian officials While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas head of the Colombian coffee producers federation who was in Europe Cardenas left a positive letter Rosenbaum said The Cardenas letter responded to a US letter last month which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula for the reintroduction of quotas but outlined several concerns with the technical details of the Colombian plan Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by European coffee roasters and traders Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement The US has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas unless objective criteria which reflect recent changes in the coffee market are used to set export limits Commodity

spirits industry one of the smaller markets for glass containers its margins and asset returns may not materially improve Moody's said Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke said his office is expanding a plan giving temporarily ailing but well managed national banks extra time to come into compliance with its minimum capital requirements The policy which originally was intended to give well run banks in economically depressed areas more time to rebuild depleted capital levels will be broadened to apply to all national banks Clarke said in a speech to a financial seminar A text of his remarks was made public today The comptroller's office will extend the application deadline for the plan to Dec 31 1989 from Dec 31 1987 It will extend to 1995 from 1993 the deadline for banks to boost their capital levels to the required minimum level Finally it will eliminate a current requirement that a bank have capital of at least four pct to participate in the capital forbearance plan In theory a bank could be allowed to continue to operate with nearly zero capital if we approve its plan to rebuild its capital base Clarke said though he added that a bank in that situation would have a have a virtually ironclad plan for a prompt restoration of capital to be accepted The critical linkage to forbearance is that the fundamentals must be in place to assure that the bank can survive: in short capable management and financial prospects Clarke said He said the program will continue to be closed to insolvent banks and Poor's Corp said it affirmed the debt ratings of Chrysler Corp and

through the Gulf in addition to putting some of its own vessels under American flags State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley who made the disclosure about the tankers also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering US flag vessels with the Maritime Administration Oakley said She emphasized however that if some charter arrangement could be worked out it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis In both cases the ships would be eligible for US Navy escort in the Gulf she said The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan administrator of the Martime Administration as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company whose identify he did not know that chartered vessels flying the US flag would be protected the newspaper reported Concerning Saudi Arabia Oakley said we are moving forward in our talks  on how we can tailor our

expected soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock According to the letter to company employess Dayton Hudson management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover According to the letter chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain independent Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich appealing for legislative help A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend itself Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators would probably look at language similar to that contained in Indiana and New York law He said any amendment proposed would probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a company for its own profit Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we have would not protect them enough Vanasek said Banks Inc and Home Federal Bank of Florida said they filed a suit against the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp The companies said the suit asks a Jacksonville Fla federal district court to enjoin the enforcement of an interpretive rule adopted by the FHLBB last year which seeks to give it jurisdiction over

step away from automobiles and towards military contracting with the purchase of Electrospace Systems Inc <ELE> analysts said A chief goal of Chrysler is to gain military business for their Gulfstream planes and this should help that cause dramatically said analyst Gary Glaser at First Boston Corp Chrysler which bought Gulfstream Aerospace Corp in 1985 earlier said Electrospace agreed to be acquired in a friendly merger for about 367 mln dlrs Analysts said the merger continues a trend in the automobile industry of diversification away from carmaking General Motors Corp <GM> paid about five billion dlrs for Hughes Aircraft an aerospace company in 1985 A year earlier it bought Electronic Data Systems a data processing firm for about 25 billion dlrs Meanwhile Ford Motor Co <F> has added First Nationwide Savings as part of a move into financial services Ford which has a huge stockpile of cash has indicated its interest in aerospace with Lockheed Corp <LK> once rumored as a possible target Both Ford and Lockheed have denied the rumors according to analysts Ford has about 95 billion dlrs of cash and securities on hand one analyst said The overall strategic thrust (within the car industry) is to become somewhat less sensitive to the vagaries of the automobile sales cycle said analyst Jack Kirnan at Kidder Peabody and Co One way companies feel they can do it particularly GM and Chrysler is by diversifying into aerospace Kirnan said Ford has been a little bit of a laggard in that area he said which has been a concern to some investors Chrysler's first big move away from autos came in 1985 when it purchased Gulfstream for 637 mln dlrs Defense analysts said Chrysler was paying a high price for Electrospace but auto analysts regarded it as a modest outlay for the company Electrospace earned 10 mln dlrs on sales of 191 mln dlrs in fiscal 1987 ended April 3 Kirnan said Chrysler may have some trouble digesting the Richardson Texas electronics firm because it is also buying American Motors Corp <AMC> for about two billion dlrs in a deal set to close later this year Chrysler will have their hands full absorbing AMC for a year or more and will absorb a lot of debt Kirnan said making them the most heavily leveraged auto company But other analysts said the relative small size of Electrospace will make it easy for Chrysler to absorb Analysts also noted that Hughes has contributed significantly to GM and that Gulfstream provided about 57 mln dlrs in pretax earnings to Chrysler last year In a statement Chrysler said 92 pct of Electrospace's sales were to the military In addition to helping Gulfstream gain government business Chrysler said it believes electronics technology will help the automobile business Robert Miller Jr Chrysler Corp vice chairman said that Gulfstream's business for example involves electronics composites and aerodynamic design Those will all be important technologies for winning in the automobile business in the 1990s Miller told Electrospace should add significantly to the electronics area he said Miller said Electrospace earnings last year were hurt by one-time items and but should recover this year Miller said cash on hand will be used to pay for Electrospace They have a substantial presence in Washington with 150 or more professional people They also have accounting systems in Texas to manage their business with the Defense Department he said Both should be important in moving Gulfstream into the military market Gulfstream traditionally has been aimed more at the commercial market which is a different kettle of fish Miller said loans on the books of major US banks excluding acceptances fell 896 mln dlrs to 27561 billion in the week ended June 10 the Federal Reserve Board said The Fed said that business loans including acceptances fell 546 mln dlrs to 27812 billion dlrs Federal Court Judge Shirley Wohl Kram said she would rule Monday on whether to grant a request to block a 78 dlr per

military contracts to Japan's Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> over a Toshiba subsidiary's transfer of submarine technology to the Soviet Union a senior defense official said We are not approving any new contracts (with Toshiba) pending a satisfactory resolution of this entire matter Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Stephen Bryen told confirming published reports on the matter The temporary ban which Bryen said has been in effect unofficially since April could cost Toshiba hundreds of mlns of dlrs in electronics business with the Pentagon including a pending 100 mln dlr Air Force deal for small computers Bryen said the US military services have not signed any contracts with Toshiba since April when publicity arose over subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co's alleged sale to Moscow of milling machines which will grind silent submarine propellers The Japanese government has been investigating the case and it was previously reported that Toshiba Machine sold four large milling machines to the Soviet Union in late 1983 or early 1984 But Bryen told in an interview that the Pentagon has now been informed by Japanese police that at least four more smaller machines capable of making such precision propellers were also sold to the Kremlin apparently in 1984 There may be even more beyond that I don't know yet Bryen said Toshiba is known to be seeking a US Air Force contract for 90000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs The Air Force has called for new bids on that contract partly because of the Toshiba investigation Pentagon officials said The officials who asked not to be identified said the computer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding because of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by US import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics Two days ago three US senators said they wanted a temporary ban on all US imports of Toshiba Corp products including television sets and videotape recorders Senators Jake Garn of Utah Richard Shelby of Alabama and John Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to a major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology transfer and Pentagon officials have told that some of the state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on Soviet attack submarines The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba Machine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one year The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was involved in the original technology transfer providing vital computer software to be used with the Japanese milling equipment But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen said that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more recent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment Co denied a report that it is interested in acquiring International Minerals and Chemical Corp (IGL) We have no interest in International Minerals or any of its divisions a spokesman told We've had no conversations with them USA Today reported that Archer-Daniels-Midland might be seeking a hostile takeover of International Minerals of several investor groups formerly associated with London investor Christopher Moran in his unsuccessful bid to take over Zondervan Corp last year said it cut its stake in the company to less than five pct In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission the group led by investors Lawrence Altschul and James Apostolakis said it cut its Zondervan stake to 157500 shares or 38 pct of the total from 246500 shares or 59 pct The group which earlier this month said in an SEC filing it wanted join with other groups to maximize share values said it sold 89000 shares between June 9 and 15 for 15 mln dlrs The group had joined with the Moran group which last year assembled a combined 44 pct stake in Zondervan during its unsuccessful takeover try Last month the Moran group broke up and splintered into various factions Moran himself withdrew from the takeover effort and last reported his personal stake at 48 pct A group led by Miwok Capital Corp a California broker with a 106 pct stake and another one led by Minneapolis stockbroker Jeffrey Wendel with 26 pct have both made recent SEC filings saying they are seeking agreements with other parties who may want to seek control of the company Pop Inc said it plans to build with its joint venture partner Puissant Group a 26 mln dlrs 120-unit Days Inn Motor Lodge at the Ohio State Fairgrounds in Columbus Construction is expected to be completed in late

two projects are organized as limited partnerships it said Reagan's nominee as top policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an agency challenged by an insider trading scandal wild stock price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the globalization of financial markets David Ruder a 58-year-old Republican law professor at Northwestern University in Evanston Ill was named Thursday to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member US Securities and Exchange Commission If confirmed by the Senate as expected he will succeed John Shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street The investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after Ivan Boesky one of Wall Street's most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures The price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some US securities markets At the same time the SEC is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the US corporate landscape And the agency is being pushed by US and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce US securities laws and guard investors from fraud Under the leadership of Shad the SEC eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's review of hostile corporate takeovers Shad who had been vice chairman of the E F Hutton investment banking firm brought a Wall Street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in 1981 In line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the administration of President Jimmy Carter a Democrat Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to significantly alter the commission's current priorities The SEC currently has about 2000 employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff The agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone By law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the White House Established by Congress in 1934 the SEC traces its origins to the great stock market crash of 1929 which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms The agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities It requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy later to become the nation's 35th president Other former chairmen include William Douglas who served from 1937 until his appointment to the US Supreme Court in 1939 and William Casey who served during President Nixon's first term and was Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year Administration asked Congress to replace the US tariff schedule with a new system to bring it into line with international tariff categories US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more accurately define new composites items not widely traded when the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago Yeutter said the Harmonized System as the new schedule is called will change tariff categories and definitions to meet the present-day needs of exporters and importers but they should pay about the same rates of duties Yeutter said American exporters will find it far easier to deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of differing systems which they now face He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule Yeutter said government and business moves are based on data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under the new system with about half expected to join the system by January 1988 Investors Service Inc said it affirmed 500 mln dlrs of debt of PNC Financial and units Affirmed were Aa-2 senior debt of PNC

committee said yesterday that subscriptions totalled about 91 pct The IMF has said that a critical mass of bank commitments is needed before it will start disbursing the 183 billion dlr standby loan that it has approved in principle for Argentina Asked what the IMF has stipulated as a critical mass Sourrouille said That has not been defined but anywhere over 90 pct we are doing fine Although most of the money has been subscribed officials noted that about a third of Argentina's 350 creditor banks hold 93 pct of its debt They are worried that it might take a long time to persuade the other banks to join the deal Monetary sources said Alfonsin and Camdessus who had not met before mostly discussed Argentina's political and economic situation Alfonsin who is beginning a four-day private visit to the US was in Philadelphia to speak to the private World Affairs Council a non-partisan body dedicated to increasing public awareness of international affairs In his speech Alfonsin said

Regulatory Commission FERC In open access gas pipelines serve purely as a transport company moving gas from suppliers to customers Pipelines also transport its own gas to customers Earlier this week Transco Energy Co <T> rejected the FERC guidelines saying it would not offer open access until the regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for gas it has bought but could not sell The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay contracts under which pipelines bought gas on long-term contracts they could not sell The problem grew severe as customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to open-access because of the take-or-pay issue But Tenneco today said open access is one of the steps FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the US FERC is moving the industry through this restructuring now even before all transitional problems are solved A spokesman said Tenneco faces 17 billion dlrs in exposure under the take-or-pay contracts but he had no specific figure for Tennessee Gas which runs 2000 miles of pipelines from Louisiana and Texas up to New England We remain convinced that the most critical transitional issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by FERC in the near future A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the industry's continued ability to provide its customers with reliable natural gas said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co president RC Thomas Gas Co Ltd said it agreed

Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up they say These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession? said Lyle Gramley chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official The Commerce Department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 48 pct annual rate in the first quarter but a US monetary official called it a weak report Housing starts fell 27 pct in May

Merrill Lynch Economics told Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages To offset this US exports must continue to rise returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption he says I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening but it is a close call Gramley said Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 48 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along The pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy - possibly a signal that the Fed will be accommodative Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession Mauro said a 05 pct rise in industrial production in May came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry where an inventory overhang still exists He says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper chemicals and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity but I think they will keep us out of a recession Mauro said In a speech to financial planners this week Beryl Sprinkel the chief White House economic adviser predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable he said But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation Allen Sinai chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 45 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 11 pct increase in 1986 The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services he said The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle it continues to persist he said adding he would like the Fed to tighten credit A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar which should continue to fall and feed inflation says a prominent international banker Rainer Gut chairman of Credit Suisse told the National Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the United States is the world's largest debtor nation The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever It is very difficult to be optimistic Gut said Food and Drug Administration said stepped up testing of condoms by the agency has led to a three recalls by US manufacturers and the detention of foreign-made condoms at US borders The FDA said industry standards require that roughly no more than four out of 1000 condoms leak Condoms are tested by pouring 10 ounces of water in each and looking for leakage The FDA said Schmid Laboratories of Little Falls NJ has voluntarily recalled one lot of Sheik Fetherlite condoms which was distributed to 22 accounts through the United States The agency said Schmid reported that almost all of the condoms were still in transit or at wholesalers at the time of the recall and are being recovered National Sanitary Labs of Lincolnwood Ill voluntarily recalled a lot of Protex Contracept Plus brand latex condoms which were distributed to a wholesaler in California and two retailers in Indiana and Michigan the FDA said The FDA said National estimates that none of the suspect lot remains on the market The FDA also said National recalled two more lots of condoms following additional FDA tests The FDA also said Circle Rubber Corp of Newark NJ is voluntarily recalling Saxon and L'appel condoms after being informed of FDA test results The FDA said the condoms were distributed in North Carolina and Illinois The FDA urged condom makers on April 7 to inform consumers about how condoms should be used to increase protection against sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS Since April the FDA said it had detained 15 shipments of condoms made by firms in Korea and four shipments of condoms from Malaysia Inc said operations at its joint venture with Summa Medical Corp <SUMAO> has ended The company said the venture provided production and purification services to biotechnology companies on a contract basis Endotronics which is reorganizing under Chapter 11 has a 75 pct stake in the partnership The company said it intends to sell the facility that housed the operations It said it is reviewing the adequacy of a two mln dlr reserve set up in the second quarter ended March 31 for the carrying value of the facility The company said the cessation of the joint venture was the second move taken to refocus its operations on the instrumentation business The company previously said it was no longer performing research and development for its health care technologies Oak Partners a Connecticut investment partnership said it raised its stake in Facet Enterprises Inc to 480000 shares or 96 pct of the total outstanding common stock from 300000 shares or 60 pct In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Charter Oak said it bought 180000 Facet common shares on June 12 at 1825 dlrs each six basis point rise of the past month in US debt futures may be extended next week by a series of US economic reports analysts said as long as the dollar holds firm Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis points over the last month largely over indications that inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing US trade balance in nominal terms Samuel Kahan chief financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government Securities said Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in the economy during the first quarter but his concern is whether the US economy will sustain that strength in the longer term Weak US economic growth could hurt the dollar which has become more important to the direction of debt futures than the beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy The median trade expectations for Tuesday's US Consumer Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 04 pct and down 15 pct respectively Meanwhile the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money supply announced this week was surprising much larger than expected according to Kahan Unless quickly reversed such a trend will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative Kahan said Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which Kahan said have slowed to a crawl below Federal Reserve Board annual targets the consequences could be a hint of economic weakness down the road he said Based on chart formations T-bond futures may be poised for further gains although the advance has been slowed recently analysts said September T-bonds are up almost six points since about May 18 Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted September bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93 in mid-June Duggan said While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through chart support the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted above the 93 level The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken out before this activity is anything other than a trading range market Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst Brian Singer said The dollar remains the key fundamental factor and the US currency has made little headway of late analysts said The critical variable remaining in the market is the value of the dollar Kahan said Additional influences next week will be possible developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting and the impact and size of the US budget deficit although these will not be in the forefront of the market early next week Kahan said In looking ahead to the US Treasury mini-refunding auctions of 2425 billion in T-notes on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday Singer said the market will likely greet the results with little excitement However a successful auction could prove to be a turning point depending on prevailing market psychology federal judge heard arguments that Manville Corp's chapter 11 reorganization plan which was confirmed in December should be thrown out During a four-and-a-half hour hearing US District Judge Whitman Knapp heard arguments in five different appeals Whitman took the issues under advisement and will rule at a later date Key challenges were made by a group of Manville shareholders who claim they were not adequately represented during the bankruptcy proceedings and that a 25 billion dlr fund to pay victims of asbestos is overfunded Another challenge came from a group of asbestos victims who claimed the trust fund was underfunded Today Manville lawyers said there have been about 54000 claims filed by those injured by asbestos The reorganization plan also sets up a trust fund with initial funding of 125 mln dlrs to pay for property damage claims Additional funds will be available if needed Manville said there are currently 9500 property damage claims filed Manville filed for bankruptcy in 1982 and its reorganization plan was approved by all parties except the common stockholders The stockholders objected to the proposal because it would greatly dilute the value of their holdings The plan would have the effect of converting every eight shares of common stock into just one share Manville lawyers today criticized shareholder groups for further delaying the execution of the bankruptcy plan Herbert Edelman one of Manville's lawyers pointed out that many thousands of victims and creditors were still awaiting payments and that many victims had already died He also pointed out that the bankruptcy court had found Manville to be insolvent They (shareholders) want the plan put aside to get that nebulous value that may be down the road Edelman said Common shareholders claim they were not adequately represented because US Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland refused requests to divide the equity holders committee into two separate groups one repesenting common shareholders and the other preferred stock shareholders During confirmation hearings of the plan the equity committee's lawyer George Hahn walked out of the hearing saying he could not represent both groups The equity holders committee was then abolished An unofficial committee representing 10 pct of the company's stock was present at the confirmation hearings However lawyers for that committee did not present evidence or cross examine witnesses During today's hearing Paul Gonson a Washington lawyer representing the Securities and Exchange Commission told Judge Knapp that the agency was also concerned that the shareholders did not have adequate representation Knapp said the unofficial committee was represented by the New York law firm of Kronish Lieb Weiner and Hellman They have one of the best law firms in town Knapp said World Bank is

workers began at 12:01 AM (0401 GMT) after the network imposed a contract which the union said was unacceptable The union said its main objection to the contract was that it permitted NBC to employ

anti-submarine defences after illegal high-technology Japanese exports significantly damaged mutual security US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Weinberger told a press conference that exports of Japanese machines designed to make Soviet submarines quieter and harder to detect had been a serious blow But he said he was encouraged by the punishment dealt to Toshiba Machine Co a subsidiary of Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> for the illegal exports and by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's assurances that action would be taken to keep it from happening again The government has barred Toshiba Machine from exporting to Communist countries for a year and said it intends to strengthen and expand its export control system Weinberger gave no details of the anti-submarine program In his talks with Japanese Defence Minister Yuko Kurihara he said he made a pitch for American companies seeking to build Japan's new fighter aircraft for the 1990's I assured Minister Kurihara that I support his plans to increase Japanese air defence capabilites and that I believe American aircraft can do this he said The Japanese industry argues it should develop the fighter plane on its own talks last week

Representative Jim Murphy has returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline for agreement set last August when the two sides resolved a related dispute over EC restrictions on US Citrus imports The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly It was also possible the US Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC pasta lifted

said It said Sourrouille would urge the IMF to release a 480 mln dlrs compensatory loan for falling exports as well as the first two tranches of a standby loan totalling 450 mln dlrs Release of the

federal revenues next year if they back his plan to reform the budget process White House Budget Chief James Miller said If the Democrats want to insist that the president say whatever is agreed to is a tax increase then they'd better just forget it because he's not going to do that Miller said in an interview with But there are a lot of revenues other than those the president proposed (in his January budget plan) I think that we might look seriously at he added The Reagan budget which has been widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress envisages raising 22 billion dlrs in new revenues through the sale of a package of government assets and new fees on certain federal services President Reagan has repeatedly vowed to veto any tax increase voted by Congress for the 1988 financial year arguing that cutting domestic spending was a better way to reduce the huge federal deficit The deficit which totaled 221 billion dlrs last year is expected to decline to about 175 billion dlrs this year and would fall to about 140 billion dlrs next year under a budget blueprint recently approved by Congress The one trillion dlr congressional budget plan contains about 19 billion dlr in additional revenues from new taxes in the government's budgetary year beginning October 1 The plan does not say how the additional revenues are to be raised leaving it to the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees to fill in the details later this year Miller appeared to be signaling that the president might consider some sort of tax increase despite his frequently stated rejection of the concept However Miller declined to say which new revenue sources might be acceptable to the president I think it would be counterproductive for me to (set out options) which might suggest that we have one thing or another in mind the White House budget chief said He cautioned Congress about the political repercussions of certain moves such as raising excise taxes on beer cigarettes or telephone service or raising corporate or personal income tax rates I think that those in Congress who think it will be a simple matter to go along with some increase in excise taxes are underestimating what they would be getting themselves into he said What they don't really realize is that the political opposition they are going to feel to excise taxes is going to be a lot hotter tahn the political opposition to user fees in certain ways or asset sales he continued But there are a lot of other things and revenue issues in government that probably ought to be addressed he said Before agreeing to a revenue package the president would insist on reform of the budget process Miller said The president is not going to take a sucker punch He's not going to sit down and try to negotiate out a budget when we can't be sure that whatever the president agrees to in fact will be delivered he emphasized We'd like to have a budget process that gives us a contract so that if the president agrees to something he can depend on its coming through After returning to the United States from the economic summit in Venice earlier this month President Reagan revived an earlier unsuccessful campaign for budget reform calling for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget and the power -- called a line-item veto -- to block individual items in congressional spending bills At the Venice summit US trading partners called on Washington to cut its budget deficit to help reduce global trade imbalances Miller told an Italian journalist here yesterday that US trading partners have to have faith and trust in the ability of the United tates to deal with its problems He said a deficit cut of about 40 to 45 billion dlrs a year is about the optimal rate of reduction in the deficit I don't think we can end the deficit overnight I think we've got to have a gradual reduction over a period of several years Miller is in Beaver Creek attending the sixth

increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran diplomats said They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington As Iran knows very well what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage said one western diplomat Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on soft targets such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf The risk of Iranian attack on US Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the US Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low However There is the threat that the Iranians seeing these heavily protected US-flag tankers will go for softer targets one diplomat said Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us The US is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz The build-up ties in with US plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which the US says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz The Missouri with its four-escort flotilla is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles diplomats said A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula within range of Kuwait But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation likely moving world opinion against Iran remarked one Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf Rafsanjani who is also parliamentary leader predicted last Friday a river of blood throughout the world in the event of any US strike against Iran Western diplomats said Iran which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the US itself Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran they added Corp is negotiating with the Chinese Government owned First Autoworks about a

director George Kern who heads the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of Sullivan and Cromwell decided against amending Allied's SEC filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers it said Securities law requires takeover target companies to promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets The day

years or less and were issued before 1984 the spokesman said He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an adverse effect on US issuers of the bonds because the general decline in interest

hospital workers is for workers to wear protective clothing rather than through routine tests of all hospital patients for the disease The non-profit advocacy organization which represents hospitals and patients recommended that hospital workers should wear protective gear whenever there is a chance they will be exposed to blood or other bodily fluids regardless of whether the fluids are known to be infected with AIDS The group also said that reliance on negative AIDS test results to determine when to take specific precautions can lead to a false sense of security among health care workers So far there are nine cases on record of hospital workers contracting AIDS from hospital patients Despite the low risk of contracting the group said Hospital workers are understandly concerned about their vulnerability (to AIDS) There are 36 mln workers in the nation's hospitals with nurses and housekeepers the most likely to come in contact with blood and body fluids on a daily basis the group said Among the Americal Hospital Association's recommendations were that health care workers exposed to body fluids must wear gloves and in some cases gowns masks and eye coverings Crafts Inc said it

metropolitan area's economy a leading business-backed organization said The Bay Area Council a group of more than 300 business firms said that a study of corporate restructuring in a nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding communities had not Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986 but another 21 firms were added to the list Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco During the period only six located in the city achieved Fortune 500 status Ted Hall a council director and local managing director of McKinsey and Co which conducted the survey said the study grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously hurt the economic climate of northern California However Hall said that only about 36000 jobs had been lost in the region while more than 600000 new jobs were created during the period At the same time he said the region experienced a greater rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest of the United States and California Council President George Keller who also is chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron Corp told a news conference that the region had difficulties in persuading companies to locate there because of a fragmented local political system But he said that because of the amenities of living in San Francisco he was the envy of many chief executives in other metropolitan area It's a great place to run a business he added but it's a hell of a place to do business with government The study concluded that Chevron which mergered with Gulf Oil in 1984 would benefit in the long run from the restructuring activity Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period were Crown Zellerbach Memorex Southern Pacific Castle & Cooke and Rolm Companies that grew enough during the period to make the Fortune 500 list included Apple

advantage of superior experience over their Japanese competitors in the new promising business of bringing asset rich Japanese investors to the US financial futures markets Japan allowed local financial institutions last month to start using overseas futures in currencies bonds and stocks to help them manage their bulging foreign portfolios US investment banks are going to take advantage We've been in the business for two decades the Japanese have not said Eugene Atkinson president of Goldman Sachs Japan Corp Japanese investors were assumed to be eager to get into the new markets but in fact participation so far has been slow Japanese securities and bank sources in New York said Koichi Kane Executive Vice President of Nomura Securities International said They're still in a starting up period They're testing the water Atkinson added But once they start the Japanese are likely to become very big players opening up lucrative business opportunities he said US investment banking sources said the slow start is understandable because US institutional investors too are fairly new to the market Futures markets have a long history in the US but because of the high risks involved American pension funds and mutual funds were not allowed to use the markets until relatively recently a US investment bank futures analyst said In addition to Japan's inexperience in financial futures an insufficient number of brokers in Japan is also to be blamed for the slow start the Japanese sources said Japan is liberalizing its financial markets but domestic financial institutions are still not allowed to act as brokers in Japan for overseas futures markets This may change next year when bankers speculate that securities houses will be permitted to enter this line of business While the Japanese are out of the business the Americans have moved in with First Boston Corp Salomon Brothers Inc Goldman Sachs and Co Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc and PainWebber Inc leading the charge they said In the US Nikko Securities Co International Inc is preparing to become a clearing member of the Chicago Boad of Trade (CBT)in anticipation of growing Japanese demand for futures products Akira Tokutomi of Nikko said Nomura Japan's largest securities house has not yet decided whether to expand its futures brokerage business in the US to establish closer links between Japanese investors and the US futures markets Kane said The evening session of CBT inaugurated recently to coincide with early Tokyo business hours has increased Japanese participation to some extent but the brokerage issue is still a hurdle the Japanese sources said High liquidity is the biggest attraction of the futures market so the Japanese naturally want to join the daytime trading session in Chicago if possible they said The Japanese are in the process of selecting brokers and establishing channels to pay fees and margins but harmonizing clerical procedures and bridging the time gap between Tokyo and Chicago are proving to be a burden the sources said Some Japanese banks which are largely barred from the securities industry in Japan have contemplated buying into the US brokerage business the Japanese sources said One of the motives for doing so is to save on commissions which was also a spur for US commercial banks to get into the brokerage business they said The simplest way may be to take over a brokerage house or to go into a business tie-up said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd in New York One trust bank source said total fees could amount to around one mln dlrs a year if his bank used the futures markets fully to hedge its huge pension fund and other assets Japanese banks have been able to penetrate aggressively many foreign financial markets by mobilizing their mammoth capital assets but the futures brokerage business to be a different story Japanese banking sources said They cited stiff fee-cutting competition in addition to difficulties recruiting influential Chicago brokers In anticipation of sizeable orders in the future some US brokers are now taking orders from the Japanese at around 13 dlrs per contract below the break-even level they said Some Chicago brokers and brokerage houses are trying to approach Japanese financial institutions about possible tie-ups a futures indusry source in Chicago said But Japanese bank sources in New York said the small capital base of many of these brokerages is making the Japanese nervous about a capital link Japanese banks are unlikely to ignore the brokerage business once financial futures trading by the Japanese starts growing fast and proves to be profitable they said But the big question they added is whether the Japanese government would let banks engage in this new risky business documents filed with the US bankruptcy court by attorneys for Allis-Chalmers Corp <AH> listed Equitable Life Assurance Co as one of the largest creditors According to the court papers Equitable was owed a total of 468859 dlrs Other creditors included Connecticut General Life Insurance Co owed 192520 dlrs and New York Life Insurance Co owed 146553 dlrs The list of unsecured

businesses that do not contribute adequately to cash flow The company said it plans to eliminate unprofitable product lines and emphasize more profitable product lines Allis-Chalmers said it intended to obtain workforce reductions and seek monetary and other concessions from salaried and hourly employees It said it will eliminate operations of facilities that are marginal performers The company said it plans to discontinue burdensome contracts and leases as well as collective bargaining agreements The company said it believes creditors will realize more from a reorganization than from a liquidation The documents said Allis-Chalmers has suffered substantial losses since 1981 due to sales declines caused by fierce competition and a sluggish global economy It said a restructuring plan which it has already instituted adversely affected cash flow because certain costs including product liability and retiree medical and pension costs continued as before despite a reduction in the size of its business Communications Inc said it expects its second quarter earnings to be lower than last year's income of seven cts per share but its revenue for the period should increase by 20 pct over the 27 mln dlrs reported a year ago The decline in second quarter earnings is attributable to higher operating costs resulting from increased sales development and expansion Gateway said Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to disapprove clean-air plans for 14 metropolitan areas and called for bans in those areas on new construction of potentially polluting facilties EPA Administrator Lee Thomas said in a statement the areas had not shown they could meet agency ozone or carbon-monoxide air-quality standards by the end of 1987 or soon after He said the proposed ban on construction would cover such industries as electric utilities iron and steel production plants industrial boilers and petroleum refineries The areas affected are Chicago; the Indiana portion of the Chicago area; East St Louis Ill; the Indiana portion of the Louisville Ky area; Cleveland Ohio; Atlanta Ga; Dallas-Ft Worth Tex; Denver Colo; the California south coast including Los Angeles; Fresno Sacramenta Ventura and Kern counties Calif and Washoe County (Reno) Nev Thomas also proposed major changes to existing sources of pollution in those areas They would effective after a final assessment of the area's pollution expected late this year or early next For Cleveland the EPA also proposed a restriction on federal highway funding and clean-air grants because the state of Ohio did not provide for adequate testing to curb car pollutions as required by the Clean AirAct Thomas said: It is clear that the state implementation plans for these areas will not achieve federal ozone or carbon-monoxide standards under the deadline mandated by Congress In these circumstances the Clean Air Act leaves no discretion I must propose sanctions The EPA estimated that another 20 metropolitan areas will fail to meet the agency's ozone standards by the end of the year About 70 are meeting the ozone standards It added that about 80 areas are now not meeting the EPA carbon-monoxide standards but only a few will have long-term problems in meeting the standards The EPA has proposed that car-makers be ordered to install canisters on new cars beginning in 1979 to capture polluting gasoline

be another month or two of very weak new home sales but with interest rates stabilizing sale of new homes should become more stable by mid-summer said economist Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc The drop in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616000 units was the largest since January 1982 the Commerce Department said Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at about 908 pct in March and rose to about 107 pct in April according to Stephen Roach economist at Morgan Stanley The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out of the market he and others said The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly unexpected by homebuyers said Cynthia Latta an economist with Data Resources They were so startled they wanted to hold back and see what would happen The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was sharper than expected some economists said We fully expected a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated said James Christian chief economist for the US League of Savings Institutions Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of existing homes which are generally less expensive than new homes Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were reflected in sales of existing but not new homes Christian of the US League of Savings Institutions said Underlying housing demand remains strong I think the market is going to stabilize and give us a good second half Others were less optimistic however We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family housing said Chimerine of Wharton Eugene Sherman chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York said The lower

Pennzoil Co <PZL> could affect the outcome of the 103 billion dlr legal saga some analysts said Texaco today said the SEC would file a friend of the court brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the case Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since they said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the rule and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas courts Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four to 78-7/8 A Pennzoil attorney would not comment He said the SEC rule 10b-13 is part of Texaco's argument in its request for a Texas Supreme Court case and that the matter has been previously addressed in court Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC brief but it did not know whether the brief would support the view of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for clarification of the reasons for two lower state court decisions Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme Court to accept the case for review with respect to the issue Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a tender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an alleged agreement on January 3 1984 to buy Getty shares Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those making the offer from entering into contracts for the target company's stock Frederick Leuffer of CJ Lawrence believes SEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could also have no affect If this friend of the court brief is potent and clearly pro-Texaco and is taken into account by the Texas Supreme Court there is a chance the entire judgment could be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing Leuffer said Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal battle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil A Texas court awarded Pennzoil a record 1053 billion dlrs in damages later reduced by two billion dlrs With interest the award now totals 103 billion dlrs Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws earlier this year Its action was designed to avoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security bond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of July 20 In his comments Leuffer also reflected the views of other analysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a significant role The other argument is the court will ignore it (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court briefs he said Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not expect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case Everyday you're going to see something like this Cohen said Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe that the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it believed the 10b-13 rule was involved I think what the market sensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that they may reach for the stars and fall on their face Sales said They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas said Joel Fischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert But Fischer and other analysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal law that could help Texaco take its case to the US Supreme Court if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or refuses to hear its case Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to the 10b-13 issue Sales said the point was argued and the courts acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the legal affect of what the regulation required and we hope we can correct that misimpression Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many possible outcomes One arbitrager said there was concern that Texaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded by Pennzoil The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae (friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit disturbed said Cohen What you're seeing is a continual chess game Every slight move down the road could have a multiplying

company South Utilities Inc said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has requested a 30-day stay of a US Court of Appeals ruling ordering the commission to reconsider its allocation of costs from the Grand Gulf One nuclear power plant More than two years ago FERC set the allocation af Grand Gulf capacity and costs among the four Middle South operating companies These allocations in turn have become the basis for contested rate filings the four operating utilities made to regulators in their service areas In a ruling dated June 24 and distributed June 26 the US Court of Appeals in Washington reversed its January 1987 decision and ordered FERC to explain its criteria for determining undue discrimination and why the FERC's allocation currently in effect is not unduly discriminatory under that definition Middle South said The company said the ruling by the three-judge appeals court panel was totally unexpected especially in light of the timetable the full 11-member court set in April of this year when it announced that all judges would rehear the panel's January decision in which the panel had upheld FERC In essence Middle South said the three-member panel has adopted the dissenting opinion as the new majority opinion and the full court has accepted the new decision The company said it supports FERC's motion for a stay The commission said it needed the time to determine the appropriate course it should take in light of the new court decision Given its complexity and the need for clarification by the FERC the significance of this latest order will take time to determine Middle South said in a statement div 35 cts vs 41 cts prior Pay July 31 Record July 15 International Inc said it terminated takeover discussions with a US-based investors group after

lower than last year's 304 dlrs per share Donald Weber president and chief executive officer of Contel said that lower than expected revenues higher than anticipated costs to complete certain contracts and one-time expenses are behind the lower earnings projections As such Weber said Contel has begun to evaluate strategies budgets and operating direction in each of the company's divisions with renewed emphasis on maximizing shareholder value Weber added that Contel is holding discussions with <Comsat> on an agreement to terminate the previosuly proposed merger between the two companies Weber added that the results of the evaluations of certain parts of the company may be reflected later this year in a combination of one-time gains or losses not in the anticipated lower earnings Webber said however that he was encouraged by the continued strength of Contel's telephone businesses and the strong showing from certain of the company's non-regulated sectors But he added that results for other parts of the company will still be unsatisfactory Corp is in excellent financial condition and expects record earnings in the second half of fiscal 1987 Chairman John Meinert said in

for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire including its related domestic and foreign operations and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30 1984 The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer Last year the company had sales of 26 billion dlrs with 19 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations Last year General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 11 billion dlrs and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 31 billion dlrs GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 15 billion dlr debt In April GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct or 125 mln shares of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 16 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company including general tire The price paid for General tire would not cause us to reevaluate that estimate said Tilden General Tire employs 10000 people worldwide and has four tire manufacturing plants in the US and one in Canada In a statemnet A William Reynolds GenCorp chairman said the sale of General Tire represents a critical accomplishment in our plan to restructure GenCorp Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of its other

Development (HUD) said it backed an eventual severing of the link between the government and the Federal National Mortgage Association -- better known as Fannie Mae But the department in a long-awaited report requested by Congress in 1984 shied from setting a timetable for the giant housing finance institution to end its government ties Instead it said specific recommendations would come in a second report to be issued jointly by Fannie Mae and HUD by Oct 1 The basic policy directive underlying FNMA's history has been consistent -- a gradual movement toward fully private status There appears to be no need to change that policy the HUD report said Any change in Fannie Mae's status would be up to Congress The HUD report said the options open to Congress ranged from doing nothing to full and immediate privatization Whatever option is selected the combination of the favorable economic environment FNMA's recent move to financial health the current strength of the housing market and the evolution of FNMA's role in the mortgage market from contributor to competitor would all indicate that the time is ripe for a positive move toward privatization the report concluded Fannie Mae operated as a part of the federal government from the time it was created in 1938 until 1968 when it was rechartered by Congress and put under private ownership with government backing However it was always intended that FNMA would eventually become fully private the HUD report said Fannie Mae's critics including some Reagan administration officials espousing a free-market philosophy say government sponsorship of the agency allows it to compete unfairly with private lenders and investors But its backers claim mortgage rates would be pushed up as higher agency costs were eventually passed on to home buyers Fannie Mae was created by Congress to make capital available for housing by buying mortgages from lenders and packaging them as securities to sell investors House of Representatives passed a resolution urging President Reagan to negotiate a world-wide treaty to reduce the use of chlorofluorocarbons which are depleting the earth's ozone layer Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals used in aerosol sprays refrigeration air conditioning foam insultation fire extinguishers and cleaning solvents They were banned in the United States and Canada in 1978 but are still widely used in Europe and Japan The ozone layer of the atmosphere protects the earth against ultraviolet radiation from the Sun Scientists have warned that if chlorofluocarbons continue to deplete the ozone layer the additional ultraviolent radiation striking the earth will cause a higher rate of skin cancer The non-binding resolution was passed by voice vote loss 79 cts vs profit 30 cts Net loss

congressional sources said Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan) and Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind) ranking minority member on the Senate Agriculture Committee both have endorsed Hineman for the top CFTC post the sources said In addition Lugar has urged White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker to recommend Mark Sullivan White House associate personnel director as CFTC commissioner they said Phillips's departure July 24 will create a vacancy on the five-person commission and require the White House to appoint a new chairman Earlier this month Sullivan emerged as a leading candidate to replace Phillips according to industry and congressional sources But Sullivan's lack of experience in commodity markets has been cited as a liability by industry representatives Hineman a Kansas

mln dlrs of debt is affected S and P said that if Dainippon is successful it is likely to discontinue its surveillance of Reichhold's debt since sufficient credit information probably will not be available A similar approach exists with respect to Polychrome Corp which was acquired by Dainippon several years ago Robins Co said its board has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group Inc <ROR> merits further consideration At the request of the board Rorer has agreed to extend until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from AH Robins After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last Thursday analysts forecast that the Robins family which holds control of the company would vigourously oppose any merger But the analysts added that Robins desire to emerge independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon Shield related liabilities After a failed first attempt earlier this year Rorer's latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln dlrs Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated 175 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320000 claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the Dalkon Shield interuterine device RepublicBank Corp said it will add 325 mln dlrs to its loan loss reserve for the second quarter The company said the move which is being made to cover loans to developed countries will result in a loss of around 313 mln dlrs in the second quarter ending June 30 First RepublicBank Corp said the increase in its loan loss reserve will lead to a loss for the full year Figures for last year are unavailable as the bank was formed in June this year after a merger of two Dallas-based banks RepublicBank Corp and InterFirst Corp The company said the 325 mln dlrs provision will increase its reserve to 11 billion dlrs out of which it will allocate 275 mln dlrs to cover its loans to 18 developing countries The company said it took the action in light of recent action taken by other major banking organizations on developing country loans US decision ending a forty-year tax treaty covering the Netherlands Antilles was unlikely to have a major impact on the Eurobond market tax experts said Most US firms stopped using financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell to the Eurobond market in July 1984 the experts said But the decision affects Eurobonds issued before July 1984 involving principal worth an estimated 30 billion dlrs and will probably mean those bonds will be called before their maturity date they said Since most of the bonds are currently trading at a premium calling them in early will mean a loss in market value for the bondholders according to a Treasury official who asked not to be identified The official said the Treasury Department was currently unsure about the impact of the move on the Eurobond market We are monitoring the situation and receiving reports from investors and issuers the official said Earlier the Treasury said it notified the Netherlands of the termination of the treaty effective January 1 1988 For years US firms seeking to avoid a 30 pct withholding tax used financial subsidiaries incorporated in the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds which are bonds issued abroad by an overseas financial subsidiary But most companies have since taken advantage of a 1984 change in the law known as the exemption for portfolio interest that allows them to sell directly in the Eurobond market and avoid the withholding tax The 1984 tax change sharply reduced the number of US companies using the Netherlands Antilles to sell Eurobonds said Steven Hannes of accounting firm Touche Ross and Co Ending the tax treaty will mean that some foreigners investing in the US through the Netherlands Antilles will lose tax benefits and probably change their portfolios Hannes said He said the decision would mainly affect foreign investors who sought tax advantages because they reside in countries which do not have a tax treaty with the United States These investors typically reside in countries in the Middle East Central and South America he said Some of them may withdraw their US investments or seek tax relief through the Netherlands itself or Switzerland but the choices are limited Hannes said It is conceivable their investment may stay here They would bear some of the tax that has not been borne in the past Hannes said US domestic bonds are not affected by the change US companies with Eurobonds issued through the Netherlands Antilles are expected to call them early to avoid the tax liability a Treasury Department spokesman said But they could refinance at lower rates because of the general decline in interest rates so the Department does not expect US firms to be hurt by the decision the spokesman said Negotiations between the United States and the Netherlands continued without success since the late 1970's The differences centered on US concern over residents of third countries avoiding US taxes by using the treaty with the Netherlands Antilles has extended its reach into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition of 50 of Sears Roebuck's <S> Sears Savings Bank branches bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities CitiCorp Savings said Thrift industry analysts said the move approved by the Federal Reserve board today is a plus for Citicorp and shows its serious intent to penetrate the California market The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into Southern California where 34 of the 50 branches are located Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California This marks our first major expansion in California particularly in the south said Citicorp Savings President Edward Valencia in a statement Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market but do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than Sears was in that market We do believe they will be a better competitor than Sears said James Stutz Executive Vice President of Home Federal Savings and Loan Association <HFD> based in San Diego Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as groundwork to establish Citicorp throughout the California market well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to operate as a bank in the state They said Citicorp is likely to convert the branches to banks at that time In the near-term however analysts said with seven billion dlrs in assets Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in the thrift market against such large California thrifts as Home Federal Great Western Financial Corp <GWF> H F Ahmanson and Co <AHM> Golden West Financial <GWD> and Great American First Savings Bank <GTA> International Monetary Fund said it approved a 48 mln dlr loan to assist Ecuador in meeting its foreign exchange needs following the earthquakes that struck in March The loan which the IMF provides countries under special circumstances is equal to 25 pct of Ecuador's quota or economic standing in the Fund The IMF said that according to recent estimates the earthquakes will hurt the country's balance of payments this year because of the loss of oil revenues due to destruction of part of the oil pipeline Holdings Corp said holders of a majority of its debt securities approved an amendment consenting to a distribution of certain assets of the company clearing the way for BCI's planned reorganization Under the previously approved reorganization BCI will be divided into two companies including a newly-formed publicly held non-food company E-II Holdings Inc BCI

shareholder lawsuit has produced a 13 mln dlr charge which the company recorded in its fourth quarter earnings The company said it will pay the settlement with company stock subject to court approval To reflect the settlement therefore the company said it has revised its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31 earnings by 13 mln dlrs or nine cts per share on a primary basis As such the company said it is recording a net loss of 580000 dlrs or four cts a share versus the net income of 740000 dlrs previously reported For the year to date ended March 31 net income was reduced to 14 mln dlrs from the 27 mln dlrs previously reported on May 28 The class action suit filed in a federal district court charged the company with various violations of federal securities laws with regards to the company's initial public offering in December 1984 and certain subsequent filings National Corp said it expects a loss of four mln dlrs for the second quarter ending June 30 against a profit of eight mln dlrs in the same year ago period The company said this will result from an addition of 23 mln dlrs to its foreign loan reserves in tandem with banking industry action It said it expects a loss for the first six months of eight mln dlrs This compares with a profit of 173 mln dlrs in the first six months of last year Corp's telecommunications equipment unit is the most likely candidate for sale by the Atlanta-based telecommunications company Wall Street analysts said Executone is at the top of the list said one analyst referring to Contel's loss-riden telecommunications equipment unit The question is who would take it? he added The company forecasting a 15 pct drop in 1987 operating earnings over last year said late today that it is reviewing all operations in an effort aimed at maximizing long-term stockholder value Analysts also said Contel's federal systems division which has been hit with several executive defections may also be put on the block Contel officials declined to comment on the possibility of selling any operations However the company indicated in a statement that it was closely evaluating the telecommunications and federal systems units Paper Co one of the leaders in the tissue and coated paper business said it expects 1987 earnings to be between 575 dlrs and 625 dlrs a share within the range proscribed by most Wall Street analysts We have put together five or six years of pretty respectable growth and three consecutive years of record earnings and I see no reason why this growth pattern should be interrupted Scott's chairman and chief executive officer Philip Lippincott told in an interview Last year the company reported earnings of 496 dlrs a share reflecting the impact of a a strike at its Mobile Alabama plant Earlier today Lippincott outlined his bullish growth scenario for analysts emphasizing that the company is dealing with the growing capacity in the industry by developing new products and modernizing plants He said that capacity increases in the industry particularly tissue paper have stymied price hikes but Scott has boosted sales by providing more distinctive products that meet the needs of consumers Scott Paper has shown tremendous growth in the last five years but I think that improvement is largely unappreciated by the market said analyst Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers who noted that the stock is selling at a relatively low price/earnings ratio They have been striving for a return on equity of 14 to 17 pct but today they were talking about a much higher objective They are raising their financial objectives Chao said Sales of consumer products increased about four pct last year and showed growth of about five pct pace in the first quarter eclipsing the overall industry wide sales pace of less than two pct Lippincott said The most favorable thing I came away with today is that their Sommerset Maine plant which makes number four coated paper is sold out through September That means their coated paper business is looking particularly good said Lawrence Ross of PaineWebber Group Inc Analyst George Adler of Smith Barney was equally optimistic They don't have anything that is going to set the world on fire right now but I am at a loss to find anything negative either Adler said He said Scott Paper is continuing to gain market share by emphasizing their strategy and developing distinctive products Lippincott also noted that the company stands to gain from the depressed level of the dollar The bottom line impact of a lower dollar was about 15 cts a share in 1986 and we could have a similar impact this year he said US judge denied Bristol Meyers Inc's request to halt Abbott Laboratories' <ABT> planned supply of AIDS tests to the Red Cross a spokeswoman for Abbott said Judge Joyce Hens Green of the US District Court in Washington DC rejected Bristol Meyers' request for a temporary restraining order against Abbott's contract set to begin July one to supply the AIDS tests and tests for hepatitis to be used on blood donated to the Red Cross the spokeswoman said She could not immediately provide Green's reasons for the ruling A Bristol Meyers spokesman was not immediately available for comment Corp said it sold 1250000 shares of Porex Technologies Corp it owned for 406 mln dlrs and pending federal approval will use the proceeds to buy 15 mln shares and

before the two countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains agreement Agriculture Department officials said The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February However any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September 1988 USDA officials said It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said Since the last meeting was only around four months ago the next talks could still be a couple more months he said There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins a USDA source said Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops he said There are too many variables now It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now Under the nonbinding pact Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of US grain per year Soviet and US officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality shipping logistics and production outlooks Corp said it has notified the State of California Regional Water Quality Control Board of a plan to remedy groundwater and soil contamination it detected at a site in

control of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its operations Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC the federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers of interstate bus companies But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways immediately The department has just begun to receive relevant information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the process of assessing the correctness of the company's allegations acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule said in comments submitted to the ICC Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of Trailways' terminals buses and garages The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that Trailways could collapse in a matter of days They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs with another six mln dlrs due June 30 The suppliers they said could force Trailways into bankruptcy at any time

overseas output over the next two years according to a Boston University School of Management survey The Manufacturing Roundtable 1987 study showed 32 pct of manufacturers plan to shift output to their domestic plants from their overseas ones or simply increase the production in their US plants That was up from 19 pct expecting to make that shift in 1986 and only 12 pct in 1984 The Boston University survey canvassed 207 firms The largest group of those surveyed 44 pct planned no changes in their US/overseas operations while 237 pct said they would boost the ratio of overseas output the poll said Jeffrey Miller professor at the School of Management and director of the Roundtable Survey said that exchange rates favored plans toward increased domestic production But he added that increased competitiveness seems to be behind the move towards greater production in the United States What's peculiar about this group is that it's the most successful in terms of profitability decreasing costs and increasing quality he told in an interview Those companies increasing offshore production are at the opposite end of the spectrum he said not meeting the production goals they set for themselves He cautioned that the survey was skewed towards large unusually profitable businesses representing a diversity of industries and regions The typical respondent was a large manufacturing division with sales of about 200 mln dlrs Inc and Schlumberger Ltd jointly announced that Schlumberger had acquired Allied-Signal's Neptune International unit Terms weren't disclosed Atlanta Ga-based Neptune which makes water meters and flow measurement equipment had sales last year of 80 mln dlrs Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it closed down the insolvent United Federal Savings and Loan Association of Durant Okla and turned its insured deposits and other assets and liabilities over to a newly created federally chartered thrift It said the failed thrift's four offices would reopen tomorrow under Bank Board management United with assets of 931 mln dlrs was closed because it had substantially dissipated its assets and earnings due to federal law violations and unsafe and unsound practices the thrift regulatory agency said The Bank Board faulted the failed thrift for its large holdings of substandard loans made in 1984-85 due to imprudent underwriting policies and controls on loans for construction and other purposes throughout the United States It also charged the thrift had violated federal rules governing conflicts of interest loans to a single borrower and changes of control The thrift was the 27th federally insured savings and loan to be closed down by the bank board so far this year Century Corp said its Commerce Savings subsidiary received 428 mln dlrs in complete redemption of certain properties in Aspen Colo that Commerce foreclosed on in April American said the amount represents the amount that Commerce bid for the properties in the April

Departments said talks were going on between the two countries dealing with Egypt's ability to build the tank and protect its high technology secrets The US Army signed a contract four weeks ago to pay General Dynamics Corp <GD> 35 billion dlrs over the next four years to build 3299 of the tanks Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified told Congress probably will not be officially notified of any final plan until after October 1 Congress would then have 30 days to veto Egypt as the first foreign co-producer of the M-1A US defense officials said Congress could approve the plan because Egypt is the only Arab country which has signed a peace treaty with Israel But they said the issues of technology transfer and a possible loss of US jobs could raise problems for the plan while Israel would also be expected to lobby against any production agreement Communications Associates Inc <DCAIO> said it has entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all the assets of Fox Technology Inc's Fox Research Inc subsidiary The company said it will assume about 10 mln dlrs of Fox liabilities with a provision for a further 65 mln dlrs based on the future financial performance of Fox during the one year period following the closing of the deal It said the acquisition is subject to approval by Fox shareholders and is expected to close in mid August Electric Co's GE Credit Corp said it agreed to buy all of the capital stock of Kraft Inc's wholly owned subsidiary D and K Financial Corp Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed D and K with assets of more than one billion dlrs is one of the leading US companies involved in the leasing of fleets of cars according to GE Credit Jim Ahtes a spokesman for GE Credit's outside public relations firm Manning Selvage and Lee Inc emphasized that the terms of the acquisition had not yet been approved Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to meet for talks The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock market There is no special worry about the stock market in Tokyo he added Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan and stability of exchange rates Asked if the US Had contacted Japan after the stock market plunge in New York Miyazawa said there was not any contact Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker on Sunday that some nations were not abiding by the spirit of the Louvre Accord were just aimed at reaffirming that agreement The agreement to cooperate in stabilising currencies was reached in Paris in February this year The finance minister made the remark at a news conference which followed a morning cabinet meeting said it understood why the US Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday Japan deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the ships navigating in the Gulf understands the circumstances that have led the United States government to take these measures the Foreign Ministry said in a statement The statement added that the threat to free and safe navigation had increased after the missile attack on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday oil prices would remain stable despite the US Attack against Iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the Gulf Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday He described the situation as extremely tense but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 185 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd he told a news conference Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were overproducing in an exaggerated manner above their assigned quotas he said OPEC's overall ceiling is 166 mln bpd the dollar goes the way of Wall Street Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a serious way Japan investment managers say The Japanese the dominant foreign investors in US Dollar securities have already sold US Equities But if the dollar falls steeply which did not happen yesterday Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw significant funds from US Shares said Akira Kawakami deputy manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's international investment department An unstable lower dollar would also affect Japanese investment in US Bonds Japan-US Interest rate differentials which currently look wide enough mean nothing in the absence of dollar stability said Kawakami US Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major US Institutional and individual investors he said The effect should be to rule out any US Interest rate rise But most Japanese investors in US Bonds are still wiating to see if the dollar really is stable he said The dollar was holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in New York yesterday most are still looking for chances to lighten their US Stock inventories Hiromitsu Sunada manager of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment department said Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points to 1738 the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914 Investment in US Stocks and bonds is difficult considering the dangers said Katsuhiko Okiyama deputy general manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed income securities marketing group Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street the managers said The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one or two weeks which is what investors have been waiting for The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 63 pct yield for the 51 pct 89th bond they said The basic background which has supported the stocks and bonds markets has not changed said Norio Okutsu assistant general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department But new outflows of funds to the US Will be decreasing However this was already evident three months ago he said cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he welcomed Monday's US And West German joint confirmation of their commitment to the Louvre accord Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were excessively concerned about the economic future The Bank of Japan will continue to adhere to a system of policy coordination based upon the Louvre accord of February he said The accord called for stability in foreign exchange rates Exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady recovery he said economists fear a world recession if stock exchanges continue to plunge Others are more sanguine The pessimists say the stocks shakeout is destroying personal assets and dampening consumption The real economic effects can be significant -- the destruction of wealth and a deflationary impact on the economy said an economist at a US Securities house But other economists said such fears were overblown Because of lower appreciation of corporate or personal assets that much negative impact could be observed (in the US) said Keikichi Honda general manager of economic research at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd But the appreciation of stock prices has not been playing such a major role in the entire US Gross national product (GNP) Honda said The pessimists noted that the record fall on Wall Street on Monday was sparked by fears the US Economy is heading for a recession or serious slowdown much earlier than expected But the optimists said a dampening effect on consumption due to stock market losses was less likely in Japan In Japan the weight of stocks in individuals' total assets is less than in the US And the total weight of individuals' holdings in the stock market is less so there will be less damage than in the US said an economist at one of Japan's major brokerage houses Japan is taking strong measures to stimulate domestic demand so while there could be some impact from the reduction of assets value it would not be a major impact said the Bank of Tokyo's Honda Optimists also pointed to incipient declines in US Interest rates as a positive sign for the US Economy US Interest rates are coming down so there is a feeling that interest rates have hit their ceiling and the US Economy is strong so there should be no direct impact from the collapse of share prices said Toshiaki Kakimoto Sumitomo Bank Ltd chief economist Some economists suggested that should markets continue to slump the major industrial nations may have to discuss possible joint lowering of official discount rates Until last week a discussion of lower rates was unthinkable now it's not said the Japanese brokerage house economist There has been a move from the purely rational to the emotional -- it's a central bankers' nightmare said the foreign economist It will require strong global leadership by politicians to snuff out he said However previously the stocks correction was due to fears of higher interest rates a possible resurgence of inflation and the depreciation of the dollar said Nobuyuki Ueda senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd Now some people have an uneasy feeling about the outlook of the US Economy Ueda said If the stock market is a leading indicator of the future movement of the economy this decline will have very significant implications for the US Economy he said If the low levels hold those who were keeping consumption high because of unrealised gains could curb consumption said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd economist Ron Napier If the paper gains aren't there people won't spend A US Recession could then trigger similar declines in other economies some economists said I don't know if a possible recession in the US Would trigger a world recession because other nations such as Japan are showing good economic performance LTCB's Ueda said But we can't rule out the possibility because the US Is still playing a very dominant role in the world economy Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the severity of the current rout on world stock markets was an absurd over-reaction sparked on Wall Street by a spreading lack of confidence in the US Economy Lawson said in a BBC radio interview This began on Wall Street It has a lot to do with the American stock market (and) a lack of confidence in the US - and some careless talk by those who should have known better In a further wave of selling this morning in London the FTSE 100 index had lost a further 2332 points only 50 minutes after the official 0800 GMT opening to stand at 18191 Lawson said a correction on world stock markets was to have been expected after the bull markets of recent years What was not expected was the severity of the downturn which quite frankly is rather absurd He said he saw no fundamental signs why the US Economy should go into recession adding Indeed the possibility of higher (US) interest rates would certainly in my judgment not lead the American economy into a recession The only way in which the American economy would go into recession was if it actually talks itself into recession he said Philippine coconut industry has greeted with relief the defeat in the US Senate of a bill requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats The bill which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture Committee on Monday could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year in lost exports the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said Naturally we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another Senate bill a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of the Philippines (UCAP) PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close with eight senators voting for it 10 against and one abstaining The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during the debate Coconut oil is high in saturated fats but unlike saturated animal fats they do not enter the blood and lymph systems leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease he said US Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour of domestic unsaturated alternatives Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated against imports and would damage the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products in 1986 up from 477 mln in 1985 UCAP figures show Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use account for about half of that total PCA's Romero said firm EF Hutton Group Inc <EFH> is not facing liquidity problems as a result of the fall on Wall Street nor is the firm on the brink of insolvency London joint managing director Harry Romney said He was replying to questions about market rumours that Hutton could be in financial difficulties Romney noted the New York-based firm employs 16000 to 17000 people worldwide Questioned on whether Hutton might be considering cutbacks in line with some other big US Securities houses he said Hutton's operations were under contuous review but no announcements were imminent and West on Monday decided to go ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Representatives of the US The Soviet Union the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants but by joining them Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich West Germany and is scheduled for completion by 1990 an IAEA statement said Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries Dieter Sigmar a leading US Fusion researcher said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste While today's nuclear power plants need uranium mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water according to experts German Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the meeting on Monday with US Treasury Secretary James Baker underscored the determination of the US And West Germany to continue close cooperation to stabilise foreign exchange rates Stoltenberg told a news conference The statement released yesterday (Monday) after the private meeting  Emphasized our determination to continue the close economic cooperation regarding foreign exchange stabilization and monetary policy Stoltenberg said that he Baker and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had all reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their meeting on Monday Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several European counterparts showed that they shared this view We expect the declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect he said He noted that the dollar firmed again in late US Trading after the outcome of the Baker meeting was published Attacks on two Iranian oil platforms in the Gulf -- both of which were still blazing -- caused damage estimated at 500 mln dlrs Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying The rigs one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack and could cause widespread pollution in the Gulf the minister told a news conference in Tehran He said the Reshadat rigs 120 miles (200 km) east of Bahrain in international waters were in the final stages of reconstruction after an attack by Iraqi jets last year Minister for Trade Negotiations is optimistic that progress is possible on reducing the large subsidies which the European Community and United States grant their farmers Michael Duffy said a European Commission scheme to reform the EC Common Agricultural Policy and US Plans to eliminate farm subsidies over 10 years are steps in the right direction I am hopefully optimistic There is goodwill in agricultural reform being shown by the USA the EC and the Cairns Group he told reporters Duffy said the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural and commodity producers is on the verge of agreeing a common position for forthcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) talks on farm subsidies The group which includes Australia and Malaysia advocates free farm trade and says US European and Japanese subsidies are stopping it competing in its traditional markets Duffy is on a two-day visit to Malaysia after talks in North and South America the EC and Thailand and leaves for Indonesia on Wednesday Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi reiterated his country would retaliate for US Navy attacks on Gulf oil platforms The US Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our national sovereignty  And we will retaliate properly for this perfidious American aggression Mousavi told a news conference in Damascus On Monday US Navy warships blasted the Rostam platform and Navy personnel stormed a second platform a few miles away Washington said the operation was aimed at destroying positions used by Iran to track and assault neutral Gulf shipping is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the US Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran He earlier estimated the damage from the US Raid at about 500 mln dlrs The rigs one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack he said Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed Aqazadeh said: Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and US Interests around the world might come under attack Aqazadeh said the US Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult but he did not see the US Attack significantly affecting oil prices IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait no other country can either and this would be to everyone's harm the radio quoted him as saying Premier Mir-Hossein Mousavi reiterated his country would retaliate for US Navy attacks on Gulf oil platforms The US Attack on Iran's oil platforms jeopardises our

voluntary compliance system for monitoring US coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources Many sectors of the trade including large roasters and importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other one analyst said On Monday a National Coffee Association newsletter said the Office of US Trade Representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill Under the arrangement milar to one in 1980 coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the US government until Congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry While many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the US others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said Last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines a US Customs spokesman said Customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesn't have the authority to demand Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to destination) he said Many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement said one major US roaster Last time we had a gentleman's agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman said another analyst adding without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers' hands Some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member countries at discounts and then bring it into the US falsely labelled According to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions said Paine Webber analyst Bernie Savaiko Still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the US in the near term It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but I think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee I don't think that it poses that

package of deficit reduction measures prior to a Nov 20 deadline In a report issued under the requirements of new balanced budget legislation approved by Congress in September the White House budget office predicted the government would take in 903 billion dlrs in revenues and spend 1066 trillion during fiscal 1988 which began Oct 1 Under the terms of the new law the government's failure to agree on a deficit reduction package by Nov 20 would trigger across-the-board spending cuts of 23 billion dlrs The White House report said this would reduce those defense spending programs covered by the legislation by 105 pct and would cut domestic programs by 85 pct This magnitude of reductions would shear 115 billion dlrs from defense and 115 billion dlrs from domestic programs The Congressional

have not indicated an urgent need for a US wheat subsidy offer and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the US/Soviet summit expected to be held next month Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told In an exclusive interview with Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made Last year it was well into the year before we offered it There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy) When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a US/Soviet summit Lyng said No I don't think so I don't think that The Agriculture Secretary said a US wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about Lyng said When Mr Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here  he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States He said it's not presidential Lyng said Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow The future of the US/Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year Lyng said but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement  We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union but do we need a long-term agreement Who benefits from that These are some of the questions we need to discuss When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement Lyng said I don't know It certainly hasn't been what we had hoped it would be For three years running they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement United States and India have not yet agreed on a food aid package to help the drought-stricken Asian country Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said Lyng told in an interview that the two countries have been discussing a package but that he did not expect the specifics of the offer to be announced during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit here this week We have been talking about the potential needs that India might have for both their commercial market and purchases needs as well as the possibilities of assistance Lyng said At this point there is no detailed plan or program The amounts of what commodities are uncertain But we have indicated to the Indians that we stand ready to assist in whatever way they deem most valuable he said There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would offer India subsidized vegetable oil under the export enhancement program and donate surplus corn under Section 419 of an amended 1949 law Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree on the mix of concessional and commercial aid and that Washington would prefer the package include something other than donated food The Indians are capable of purchasing a lot of taking care of themselves India is a country that has come a long way in its ability to produce food and they have a great pride in that Lyng said We (the United States) obviously with the surpluses we still have of many commodities would like to share in the import business the Indians do and then we have some as we always do compassion for the people of India and would like to cooperate with them he said Lyng said he had no

US exporters said And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets London economists said There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett If not there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar the Fed will be forced to tighten This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the US With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world But some economists added that Wall Street's crash which dragged other major markets down with it may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent US Trade deficits If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the US They say Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates he added Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 925 pct Tuesday and US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy via a banking crisis for example thus precipitating recession It also helped the dollar rally sharply to a high of 18200 marks from a European low of 17880 But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind The United States has been able to live on borrowed time If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recessionIt contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the US Economy said Capel's Dennis But he added that markets are still very much in danger The liquidity doesn't disappearAll it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets Dennis noted David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad said Morrison The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong he said Federal Reserve is expected to enter the government securities market to add reserves via customer repurchase agreements economists said They expected the amount to total around 15 billion to two billion dlrs Economists added that the low rate on federal funds

Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the US Action have all vowed retaliation Rafsanjani the parliamentary speaker said It is not a threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will respond to

global farm reform plan at GATT later this month although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal It will help us in getting the negotiations underway Lyng told in an interview Tuesday Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26 Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains and proposing curbs on US soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe The US in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988 However the EC and some US domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic Asked about such criticism Lyng said The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them I think that is the unrealistic position I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say Lyng also rejected suggestions the US and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat That doesn't do a thing for us Lyng said The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils he said At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC The United States will be

and marketing for Toyota's US sales subsidiary told reporters Toyota's expected decline will come principally in the truck segment where the company faces intense competition from US domestic manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co <F> Toyota he said also expects to stress sales in the low and middle segments of the car market to remain competitive Asked if Toyota's US profits could show a substantial decline with its lower trucks sales in the next two years he responded conceivably it could but added Our plan is not to chase this thing to where it makes no economic sense Perkins also predicted that the 1988 US vehicle market could fall below 15 mln sales from above 15 mln expected this year He expects some smaller Japanese automakers could be forced to withdraw from the US market or to seek partnerships with one another in the face of intense competition The Toyota executive said the collapse of US stock prices and any further weakening of the dollar would likely have a very quick impact on the Japanese (car) companies In our company when the stock market goes down we see it very soon in the New York metropolitan car market New York is the best indicator of what's going to happen in the rest of of the country I can tell you from the next 15 days (of car sales) in the New York market what it will be in the rest of the country in the next six months Perkins said The Toyota executive said the panic selloff in the New York Stock Exchange hurts the car market because it does create a shock wave of doubt in the minds of consumers He said Toyota would wait at least 30 to 60 days to assess the impact of the the stock market drop on the wider economy before making any changes in its basic business plan for the US market Toyota he said expects its 1988 US sales will total at least 600000 cars and 275000 trucks compared with about 630000 cars and 300000 trucks expected for 1987 and 644000 cars and 388000 trucks sold in 1986 He said Toyota hopes it will be able to import 610000 cars from Japan in 1988 the same as its 1987 allocation under Tokyo's voluntary export restraint scheme But he said it was uncertain if Toyota would keep its current allocation becuase of pressures on Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry to roll back Japanese car export quotas from the current 23 mln annualized rate 31 cts vs 26 cts Net 1858000 vs 1388000 Sales 271

one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc <MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network We've got to loosen money we've got to keep interest rates down We can't afford to let them go up That means we're going to have to work on our twin deficits both the budget deficit and the trade deficit Regan said I certainly wouldn't tighten money at this particular moment Regan said when asked about the prospects for a recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street I think that if they were to do that they'd create the same conditions that we did in '29They choked off the money supply and what happened? We went into a major recession I think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions on program trading I think that that's exacerbated exaggerated this decline and I think it's something that they must stop he said Corp said it has authorized the repurchase of up to 20 mln shares of common stock This action has been under study and

ruling of a GATT panel on a US trade complaint against Japan expected soon may influence the US stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a US demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the US These are quota items and the principles that apply to them it seems to me will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus Lyng told in an interview He repeated the US demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31 next year The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste some cheeses and specialty fruit juices US officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman The US has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus) If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT Lyng said He declined to say what action the US would take next April if Japan continues to resist US demands 95 cts vs 30 cts Net

American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962 he said The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free in an effort to fill its oilseed needs But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax The subsidies are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes US Farmers mad as hell Adams said The ASA is confident the US Congress will support its trade complaint Adams said The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC which will be considered by the EC Commission in December US Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982 primarily as a result of EC policies Adams added Lord Plumb European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the US Halted overseas sales of soy products United States is prepared to pull out all the stops to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) US Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community's (EC) agricultural support policies he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee The US claims the EC directive due to come into effect on January 1 threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of US meat shipments into the EC The US also will oppose all EC efforts to impair US trade via the EC oilseeds regime which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax Samuels said Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected Samuels said Samuels called the US plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000 proposed at GATT in July visionary and very serious The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes dairy and sugar It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies The US Is not opposed to short-term measures as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions Samuels said Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access the US Ambassador said The US can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the US plan when it tables its own proposal he added The key difference between the two approaches is that the US wants farm subsidies eliminated while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports Samuels said If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation he added Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the US wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT 146 dlrs vs 141 dlrs Net 2775 mln vs 2683 mln

continue its policy of subsidizing farm exports to regain lost markets until there is a global agreement to end such subsidies In an interview with Lyng also acknowledged he was troubled by the prospect that the export enhancement program (EEP) could prove so indispensable to boosting US exports that the US would have difficulty abandoning it Yes I'm troubled with that a little bit he said There's no question about it the longer you feed the calf on the cow the longer it is to wean it In recent months USDA has offered subsidies on a growing list of commodities to an increasing number of countries Lyng called US and European Community export subsidies just plain nonsensical as a long-term policy and said he saw an end to the expansion of the EEP I'm sure there's an end to the expansion but we are doing this to accomplish our goal which is to regain the markets that we've lost to keep our products competitive and to let those particularly the European Community who we are

States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates European economists said But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and US Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt according to official statements released late Monday Only 13 hours after the statements were released the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 380 pct down from a 385 pct facility rate offered last week While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday It's round one to the Americans  said Richard Reid senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London But Reid added We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 005 percentage point Over the weekend criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday the dollar was quoted at 17918 marks compared with 17740 on Monday Guenther Aschoff chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes then all the better he said No central bank wants to let interest rates rise and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the US Aschoff said Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern Giles Keating economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battleBut he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington Before the IMF meeting when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 360 pct Keating noted Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability In addition both the US And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the

anticipates that the Texas State Supreme Court will agree to hear its 103 billion dlr legal battle with Pennzoil Co <PZL> over ownership of Getty Oil We expect that the Texas Supreme Court will hear our case will heed the voices of impartial third parties and will ultimately reverse this unjust decision and thus provide the simple basic justice that Texaco has asked for all along DeCrane said in a speech at a meeting of the International Association of Drilling Contractors DeCrane said he expected the Texas State Supreme Court to overturn a State Appeals Court ruling that found Texaco unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's 1984 plan to acquire Getty Oil This case has become much more than a quarrel between two companies DeCrane said It presents a far broader threat to our economic system and to justice in America as we know it today Settlement talks between the two oil companies to resolve the billion dlr lawsuit reportedly stalled earlier this year when the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a friend of the court brief in support of Texaco The agency claimed Pennzoil violated SEC rule 10B-13 which prohibits the purchase of shares privately at the same time a tender offer is outstanding DeCrane also said concerns expressed by 19 state attorneys general in the legal proceedings also favored Texaco's position The bottom line is that the SEC had intervened to insure that its rule are interpreted properly in the interest of millions of private stockholders around the country who might some day find themselves the victim of this same kind of manipulation DeCrane told the oilmen He warned that if the state appeals court judgment was upheld in Pennzoil's favor it would send out of state businesses fleeing from Texas in droves Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code last April after a state appeals court upheld Pennzoil's 103 billion dlr judgment Texaco's appeal of the decision to the Texas State Supreme Court has been pending for several weeks and the court is expected to decide soon whether it will agree to review the lower court ruling If the Texas State Supreme Court does not hear the case Texaco has said it will take its case to the US Supreme Court Manufacturing Corp said it will repurchase up to 25 mln dlrs worth of its common stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions Company

a tax credit of 90000 dlrs Inc chairman Alfred DeCrane said the massive stock market correction could affect any out of court settlement of the company's 103 billion dlr legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL> However DeCrane refused to say whether the two companies were holding any settlement negotiations Certainly the market shakeout might affect the way this is handled DeCrane told reporters following a speech at a meeting of the International Association of Drilling Contractors In this environment cash looks very important DeCrane declined to say whether Texaco and Pennzoil had held any recent settlement talks citing a confidentiality agreement between the two companies A few months ago Texaco offered 100 mln dlrs cash no strings attached just to take this appeal to the Texas Supreme Court DeCrane said He was referring to a non-settlement proposal that would have eliminated the threat of Pennzoil filing liens or ownership rights against Texaco property before the company filed for bankruptcy protection in April I think that (the offer) looks pretty good now to a Pennzoil shareholder whose stock is trading around 30 or 40 Settlement talks between the two companies reportedly broke down earlier this year after Pennzoil insisted it would not settle for less than four billion dlrs Since then Texaco has asked the Texas State Supreme Court to review the 103 billion dlr judgment against it DeCrane also said it was not clear if the stock market drop could spur further consolidation in the oil patch We know the value is there The market fluctuation has not changed the value of the underlying assets DeCrane said of publicly traded US oil companies and D Commodities a major Chicago-based commodities firm is not having any financial problems but has pulled out of the US energy futures market because of excessive volatility according to Dale Dellutri executive consultant We are not in any kind of financial problem at all but we will be out of the market because of the volatility Dellutri said Individuals and customers are getting out he added Kansas City Commodity Credit Corp office is preparing a wheat catalogue containing roughly 300 mln bushels scheduled to be released in the next two to three weeks a CCC spokesman said The catalogue should include all CCC stocks stored at terminals and about 50 pct of the stocks stored at country elevators the spokesman said Hard red winter wheat should comprise the bulk of the stocks followed by spring wheat he said The release date is tentative in case there are snags in the catalogue's preparation the spokesman said Brown and Sons Inc said it is refocusing its corporate syndicate desk away from underwriting straight corporate debt issues to emerging company debt and collateralized mortgage obligations Marc Schneebaum director of financial management with Alex Brown said the stock market's downturn did not prompt the decision Actually this is one of those ironies in timing This (refocusing) had been discussed for some time he said Alex Brown based in Baltimore is one of the larger regional securities firms global stock prices are evoking grim memories of the great market crash of 1929 but analysts are reminding investors of safeguards in place before they stash their savings under the mattress But some also say that while banking securities and social laws written during the great depression should prevent a repeat of that dismal era more protection still might have to be considered And analysts caution that while new laws can deal with some problems lawmakers can't legislate away fear--which helped drive the New York Stock Exchange to its record 508-point Dow Jones index loss on Monday That 226 percent loss nearly doubled the Oct 29 1929 loss of 117 percent On the day before that year the market fell nearly 13 per cent In a series of interviews with government congressional and private analysts most agreed safeguards exist to avoid a repeat of 1929 and its depression aftermath Charles Schultze chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers under Jimmy Carter said in an interview that the safeguards should be adequate to avoid a repeat of 1929 to 1933 The safeguards are fine he said The safeguards are adequate to prevent a cascading liquidity failure That's not the overall problem which is the dollar and trade deficits Schultze now with the Brookings Institution think-tank pointed to a weak Federal Reserve during the 1920s when the Fed acted in the wrong way in 1929--it tightened money Similarly President Reagan's budget manager James Miller told the safeguards in place should be adequate And millionaire oilman and business takeover specialist T Boone Pickens said the present safeguards should avoid any 1929 situation It is a much more sophisticated system I don't see that a comparison is valid Marvin Kosters director of economic policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute thinks the present safeguards will work The main thing is the understanding of the Federal Reserve of its responsibility to maintain liquidity in the economy he said There is no reason why this (market fall) needs to spread into the real economy Maybe it's better it happened at all Rex Hardesty of the huge labor confederation AFL-CIO said many of the present safeguards are not working saying only one-third of the unemployed are now receiving benefits He also called for an increase in the 335 dlr minimum wage which has not been raised since 1981 One of the main things that appears different in 1987 than in 1929 is market psychology analysts point out During those anything goes days of flappers and bathtub gin the stock market was the road to riches that captured the savings of shoeshine boys to bank presidents It was viewed as a highway to heaven with no turning back But happy days soon collapsed into a nationwide hysterical panic with the stock market crash wiping out paper millions and losing the life savings of many average investors as panic set in Brokers leaped from Wall Street skyscrapers American banks closed for a holiday in 1933 as depositors clamored to pull out their savings The great depression followed leading into World War II Images of those days surfaced with the unprecedented sell off on Monday but analysts maintained times are different House Banking committee specialist Jake Lewis said that bank investors should have no fears because their savings are now completely backed by the government Even though there have been record bank failures --145 last year 148 this year through today--everyone received their savings--unlike the millions lost when banks collapsed 60 years ago Banking deposits then uninsured now are fully insured by the government up to 100000 dlrs for each saver As the depression swept the nation President Franklin Roosevelt steered into law sweeping banking and securities reforms to deal with many of the problems that led to the crash and hurt people afterwards Inc denied it is having financial difficulties and said it did not halt oil futures trading today John O'Connell assistant vice president of research told Inc said its subsidiary's 60 dlr a

common shares until 10 days following Owens-Illinois compliance with the FTC request or other conditions One Corp said its board authorized the repurchase of up to 5000000 shares of its common stock The company currently has about 980 mln shares outstanding Virginia has been declared free of tuberculosis and brucellosis from its cattle population the US Agriculture Department said It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the state-federal cooperative eradication program To achieve brucellosis-free status a state's cattle population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months There are 33 states plus the US Virgin Islands classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states plus Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands which have eradicated brucellosis Only 20 states and the US Virgin islands have eradicated both diseases it noted House Budget Committee approved a package of 23 billion dlrs in taxes and budget cuts to reduce the 1988 budget deficit The 20-14 party-line vote by the Democratic-controlled committee sends the measure to the full House where House Speaker Jim Wright predicted passage next week The package--including 12 billion dlrs in taxes President Reagan has vowed to veto--was put together by other committees under a new budget law requiring a 23 billion dlr cut in the deficit to scale down the 1988 budget deficit McKinnon Securities Inc said it is not having any financial difficulties following the 508 point decline in the New York Stock Exchange on Monday The firm joined a long list of Wall Street securities companies that have been rumored to be in financial straits from losses caused in yesterday's selloff Earlier today the NYSE said there were no major membe firms reporting any financial trouble But it said that HB Shaine and Co Inc of Grand Rapids Mich could not continue to do business by new hostilities involving US forces in the Gulf the US Senate voted to end Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy The measure however does not require President Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate bill The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout of US forces from the Gulf The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue including an expression of support or of disapproval for Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in the waterway The Pentagon said the 12th US-protected convoy began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday Industries Inc said its board authorized an increase in the maximum number of shares to be repurchased under its stock buyback program to 45 mln from 25 mln The company said the board initially authorized the stock buyback in

attack mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the Iran-Iraq war defense and Middle East experts said US naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and raided another in what the administration called a measured and appropriate response to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last Friday on a US-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig rather than an onshore economic or military target such as Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to limit the political military and diplomatic fallout both at home and in the Gulf It simply demonstrated the United States will take military action when they (Iran) take military action Norman Polmar a defense analyst and author said He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the embarrassment of casualties on its own soil possibly avoiding an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack In addition it minimized the risk to US forces and the potential embarrassment of any losses including aircraft that could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack Anthony Cordesman author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq war said the United States apparently chose a limited target to keep alive the possibility that UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a Security Council call for a ceasefire We want the UN peace initiative to work if there's any chance at all he said adding that the action made it clear tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's economic lifeline Pentagon officials said the platform had been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the lower Gulf We have chosen a military target but we also have shown Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting capabilities Cordesman said He predicted the United States would respond to any future major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz followed by mining the approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran but we

shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed before they become exercisable at five cents per right The company said the rights will expire on the later of February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become exercisable It said the plan was intended to protect stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics such as market accumulations which would interfere with its ability to maximize stockholder value The rights become exercisable if any person or group acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding shares at 65 dlrs per share It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the company is acquired by a group under an agreement

Douglas Corp on future aircraft programs pointing the way to a defusion of the transatlantic dispute on subsidies to the aircraft industry French Transport Ministry Jacques Douffiagues said He told the southern French daily Depeche du Midi in an interview today that the talks between senior US And European Community officials in London on October 27 on the Airbus question should be more harmonious as a result Airbus officials said last week that they were continuing talks on possible collaboration with McDonnell Doughlas on aircraft projects including an eventual stretched version of the Airbus A320 short-haul jet but that collaboration in the immediate future was unlikely US Manufacturers and officials have charged that the French British and West German governments have disrupted the world aviation market by unfairly subsidising Airbus allowing it to undercut private US Competitors while the Europeans have responded by saying that US Manufacturers benefit from large government-funded military contracts Douffiagus said that transatlantic cooperation was already widespread in aircraft construction Express Co's <AXP> president Louis Gerstner Jr said a bear market will not effect his company's long-term strategy I don't think where the market goes over any month long period two day period or even six month period has anything to do with our strategy Gerstner told We have built a strategy for our company that looks out over many years and anticipates a lot of change he said Gerstner said the company's long term strategy is to build and maintain a major position in the financial and travel service industries American Express is the 69 pct parent of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc <SHE> Gerstner would not comment on the share market tailspin However American Express chairman James Robinson said in a statement that the company could endure the market turbulence and was in a strong position for further growth All brokerage firms make money if the market goes down or up Gerstner told without elaborating Gerstner said Shearson had no plans to quit its municipal bond activities Shearson Lehman Brothers tends to adjust to trends in incremental steps You will see it doing less of the convulsive one-time changes that people in this industry will go through he said Shearson recently laid off 150 people in London and is limiting hiring but Gerstner said American Express remains committed to the London market and to having a global presence That Shearson let a couple of hundred people go in London is not even an anthill on the landscape we're discussing We are discussing long-term strategy Gerstner said Earlier this year American Express sold 13 pct of its stake in Shearson to Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan and a further 18 pct to the public Gerstner said these moves had no implications of an exit from financial services Our committment globally is represented by the Nippon tie-up which dwarfs the fact we decided to reduce the size of one department in one company in one of our subsidiaries he said Many securities firms now are stressing merchant banking to bolster earnings hurt by bond market volatility slow retail business and a drop in underwriting volume When asked if more players would make the system more risky Gerstner said I can't comment on other firms but Shearson is not going to follow a feeding frenzy in the direction of merchant banking We are not going to overreach Gerstner also spoke about securitization or the repackaging of debt as marketable securities It is almost imperative to create a security backed by the funds flowing from an LDC (lessor developed countries) debt program It is going to happen but it is very difficult to create a security in the current climate Gerstner said Securitized products could be structured for either the retail or institutional markets Gerstner said If you look at the junk bond phenomenom it started out with mostly institutional buyers Primarily through mutual funds individual buyers became a presense in the market I'd guess we'd see a similiar situation in LDC debt he said The fundamental thing that has to happen (before there can be sucessful securitization) is that the debt burden on the countries has to be reduced and the amount of money coming from the commerical banks and the future call for money on commercial banks has to be reduced Gerstner said Corp said its board of directors has authorized a plan to repurchase up to two mln shares of its common stock subject to market conditions and the company's own financial

said that despite the unprecedented stock market decline they are confident that an upturn lies ahead In the view of our market experts yesterday's unprecedented stock market decline was an over-reaction to fears of higher interest rates more inflation and a lower dollar Indeed after examining many factors there is reason to believe than an upturn lies ahead the statement said The Merrill Lynch executives also said in the statement that the fact that bonds rallied commodities weakened and the dollar remained relatively firm suggests that the central banks may now act to provide the system with additional liquidity While further carry-over selling from yesterday and worries about a stock decline in Japan may put further pressure on the market in the near-term we believe that

Corp despite the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8 a Bank of New York spokesman said The offer still stands we have not changed our offer a Bank of New York spokesman said Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back any of its own shares Earlier this month Irving rejected the bid as inadequate and said it wanted to retain its independence In late September Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per share in cash for 474 pct of Irving For the remaining 526 pct it offered an exchange of 19 shares of its shares for one Irving share At that time the stock purchase portion was worth close to 80 dlrs per share but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per share for a net price of 68 dlrs one analyst said According to the prospectus offer shareholders may tender for all cash or all shares on a first come first serve basis Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would affect the acquisition If it gets to the Irving shareholders they would approve it but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders said Mark Alpert banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc And the market is saying the deal won't go through Alpert said The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at present If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a share then they won't go at a lower price another analyst said The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford to retain its original offer However industry sources were more uncertain about prospects for the deal With Irving's price so low Bank of New York's offer will look good to Irving shareholders said Michael Flores a consultant at Bank Earnings International a consulting firm The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share which is about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week increases the chance that Bank of New York will succeed Flores said Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking industry Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price is too depressed Alpert said Since only banks can buy another bank the only other possible acquirors would be a foreign bank Alpert said In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered more than the acquirees another analyst said Securities and Exchange Commission said it made a one-day exception to its rule of prohibiting companies from repurchasing their own stock in the last half hour of trading and

repurchases by many firms today were a contributing factor in the market's rebound from yesterday's huge losses The rule prohibiting repurchases in the final half-hour of trading works to prevent

investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very

analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand On the surface Baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets) it was West German policy said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York All Mr Baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger he said After Monday's talks the US and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord pieced together in Paris in February was still in effect Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values Treasury sources said that Baker already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite He felt that the US recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion A growing US economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports Moreover Baker the consummate politician was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off US economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 32 pct annual rate There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview In many ways the official response was mild Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled US government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact For all of this it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony Oh I think it's much too

stock brokers said Until recently Japanese net purchases of US stocks were projected to leap to eight to 12 billion dlrs this year from four billion dlrs in 1986 securities industry sources said The Japanese had suffered severely from US bond investments and now (they are suffering) in US stocks said Hiroyuki Kondo of Yasuda Trust and Banking Co Ltd Japanese portfolio investment was concentrated in Treasury securities until early this year which led to heavy currency losses following the dollar's steep decline Even though their US bond purchases moderated since then Japanese investors continued to suffer losses as bond prices fell sharply in recent months Now the historic fall in the US stock market has stunned Japanese investors killing their appetite for US stocks Keita Konishi of Sumitomo Life Insurance Co said while his firm was not panicked into an across-the-board sell-off of its US stock investments he does not expect it to resume buying stocks for some time There has been no panic selling by Japanese institutional investors so far during the stock price nosedive said Susumu Uchiyama of Yamaichi Internatinal (America) Inc Following the steep decline however Japanese are not buying even though US stocks now appear bargain-priced he said There will be no big wave of Japanese investment in the US for the time being said Keiji Tsuda of Nissei BOT Asset Management Corp an investment advisory body to Nippon Life Insurance Co It's the time to think twice The psychological impact (on investors' behaviour) will drag on considerably he said The latest turmoil in the financial market was triggered by US Treasury Secretary James Baker as he threatened a futher dollar fall in retaliation for higher West German interest rate rises and undermined foreign investors' confidence in the dollar Tsuda said The US economy is still sitting on the time bomb of huge budget and trade deficits he said and investors' worries over the twin problems have intensified Before I thought the dollar's large fall (over the past two years) would take out the detonator out of that bomb but it hasn't Tsuda said Investors and brokers said the Japanese for the first time have experienced the enormous volatality of the New York stock market often caused by program trading A stock trader at Daiwa Securities America Inc said that while Japanese investors had been attracted by American firms' superior performance relative to Japanese firms in terms of earnings per share US stocks' downside potential is now much larger than that oJapanese stocks While the Japanese stock market has also taken a nosedive it could be stabilized by the efforts of large Japanse firms A high percentage of Japanese equities are held by companies who will hold on to their stocks and the stocks of other Japanese firms in order to strengthen their business ties through this cross-holding relationship analysts said Despite the massacare on the Wall Street Japanese investors are not expected to withdraw from US stocks US equities are in a process to be built in diversification of their portfolios and the portion of them is still very small Japanese investors said But it is unclear when the Japanese will resume purchasing US stocks and much depends on the dollar's stability they said Kondo of Yasuda Trust said Japanese investors are not fully convinced that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is determined to fend the dollar's value and check future inflation in the US Because of uncertainty over the dollar's direction and inflation in the US Japanese investors have not yet jumped on the Treasury bonds despite the latest sharp bond yield rises investors said Konishi of Sumitomo Life said A US recession is being talked about so it may be time to shift back to bonds but I feel uneasy about buying any US instruments right now Tsuda of Nissei questioned the strength of the recent rally in US government bond prices He said the steep bond

statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers that he was prepared to order across the board spending cuts to comply with a Federal balanced budget law but preferred to negotiate with Congress He said he would consider anything the congressional leadership proposed but a spokesman said he remains opposed to raising taxes as a way to reduce the deficit I think it is preferable if possible that the executive and legislative branches reach a budget deficit reduction package Accordingly I am directing that discussions be undertaken with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress for that purpose Reagan said Asked whether he would consider raising taxes Reagan said I am willing to look at whatever proposal they might have As Reagan boarded the helicopter to visit his wife Nancy at Bethesda Naval Hospital he was questioned as to whether that meant he was softening on his tax stance Reagan replied if you heard that it must have been the helicopter White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater later told reporters that Reagan was not changing his opposition to tax increases Fitzwater said the administration would accept automatic cuts under the Gramm Rudman balanced budget law rather than raise taxes Earlier on Tuesday congressional leaders called for an economic summit with the White House to address the nation's budget and trade deficits that some analysts say were partly to blame for the stock market drop Reagan said he would be willing to participate personally in any negotiations with Congress The White House earlier seemed to reject the idea of negotiating with Congress on the budget deficit Fitzwater said this morning that the White House continued to oppose a budget summit with Congress on the grounds that it would be used by Democrats as a platform to press for a tax increase But Reagan announced his willingness to negotiate with Congress after meeting for about an hour with White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker Treasury Secretary James Baker Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and chief economic adviser Beryl Sprinkel and Lomb Inc said its board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to three mln of its 305 mln issued shares of common stock The company said recent turmoil in the financial markets has resulted in its stock being priced substantially below a level which it believes to be an accurate reflection of the company's present performance and future earnings potential The shares will be repurchased at management's discretion either in the open market or by private purchase and will be used in connection with acquisitions stock options and employee benefit plans Stock Exchange Chairman Maurice Mann said the exchange may have reached record volume again today following yesterday's record 176 mln shares it looks like at least the same volume as yesterday Mann said at a news conference following the close The exchange closed one-half hour early for the second straight day Mann said the exchange will determine daily whether or not to close early over the next several days Mann said the only major operational problem today occurred when the exchange had to stop trading 30 over-the-counter options 17 of which trading were restored later in the day He said the options had to be halted because price information on the underlying stocks was not being disseminated on the floor quickly enough You cannot trade an option unless you know how much its worth he said Mann said the exchange's computer system was working better than had been expected under the pressure of the heavy trading volume This system was not designed to do what it did today and yesterday he said He said technical adjustments to the system since yesterday improved today's operations He would not elaborate Mann said the decision to close the exchange early was not due to concerns over the vulnerability of being open one half hour after New York closed Rather he said it was to allow trades to be tallied in conformance with other exchanges In Los Angeles traders said although trading was hectic they were able to keep up with orders better than yesterday We could handle the orders we got Things seem to be smoothing

were halted on the exchanges Melton declined to give volumes of off-market trading the company has been doing but said its just very very busy when the stocks are halted our markets are very active He

Corp the largest bank holding company in Texas reported a loss of 63 mln dlrs for the third quarter and said that its non-performing loans rose sharply because of a further deterioration in Texas's real estate market There was no comparable figure for the third quarter of 1986 because the company was formed in June 1987 through the merger of RepublicBank Corp and Interfirst Corp Non-performing loans were 31 billion dlrs at the end of September or 124 pct of total assets mpared with 95 pct at the end of the second quarter Loans secured by real estate accounted for about 90 pct of the 706 mln dlr increase in non-performing loans in the third quarter First Republicbank said It said the poor shape of the office and retail housing markets in Dallas Houston and Austin will continue to hold back earnings As indicated earlier in 1987 by First RepublicBank the company will continue to assess future common stock dividend payments relative to earnings performance Gerald Fronterhouse chairman and chief executive officier said in a statement First RepublicBank said its third-quarter loan loss provision of 106 mln dlrs and net charge-offs of 87 mln dlrs left its total allowance for credit losses at 114 billion dlrs or 46 pct of the loan portfolio The company's primary capital amounted to 79 pct of assets at the end of September The 63 mln dlr loss was sustained despite a 29 mln dlr cut in overhead achieved partly by staff attrition The size of the combined staffs of the two banks has been cut by 12 pct so far this year and Fronterhouse said the bank is ahead of the schedule it set

additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later this month Reagan Administration officials said President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the US and third country markets and to open its home market to US goods The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on Japanese color television sets hand-held power tools and portable computers Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June after Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the US market at below production costs Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers The Administration officials said Commerce Department monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the semiconductors in third countries where they had been taking sales away from American-made semiconductors They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would be lifted by the end of the month The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the closed Japanese markets to US goods US and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance with the agreement earlier this week The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining sanctions to stay in force the officials said until Japan is in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement

Treasury Secretary William Simon sharply criticised President Reagan for irresponsible fiscal policies that contributed to this week's stock price collapse (Reagan) fell for that siren song that you can cut taxes without cutting spending and that we would 'grow our way out of this' and everything would be wonderful Simon said in an apparent reference to the massive US budget deficit Every time we hear that nonsense we ought to howl with pain as we were howling yesterday and are howling today he said in an interview taped this afternoon for the MacNeil Lehrer Newshour which will air at 1930 EDT (2330 GMT) Simon who held his post under presidents Nixon and Ford said Reagan's tax cuts are positive for saving and investment And he blamed Congress for causing the US's fiscal problems by putting self-interest ahead of national interest It's not only the president It's Congress  under Republicans and Democrats alike he said They're a bunch of hypocrites who have one credo -- that credo is

qtr 1986 nation's exchanges and brokerage houses said their computers systems have been strained by the avalanche of trading triggered by the past week's stock market collapse And while the financial instry's hi-tech resources have been able to handle the crisis the sudden surge in trading volume will likely force the exchanges and securities firms to revamp their computer systems and communications networks several years earlier than they had planned industry officials said We had already started certain processes to increase the New York Stock Exchange's capacity said Jim Squyres a spokesman for the Securities Industry Automation Corp which runs the central computer network for the New York and American Stock Exchanges We will have to seriously consider speeding that up he said After three straight days of record volume however many exchanges were pushing their systems to untested limits And while the exchanges said their computers were handling the crush brokers and traders complained about lost trades and delayed price quotes The most serious problems arose on Monday when a record fall of 508 points in the dow and volume of more than 600 mln shares on the New york stock exchange stunned the entire industry The American Stock Exchange's order-routing system crashed just 10 minutes before trading closed The Pacific Stock Exchange suspended business a half-hour early so it could catch up with a massive backlog of trades And the price-quote feed supplied by the NYSE was cut off several times during the day leaving some traders with quotes that were often 45 minutes behind the actual market Although the computers whirred away late into the night the exchanges opened on time Tuesday and problems were fewer even though NYSE volume swelled to 610 mln shares Combined volume of the NYSE American and over-the-counter exchanges topped 900 mln shares I think we're equipped for this kind of trading said Paul Stevens executive vice president of operations for the American Stock Exchange The problem is less the computers which are handling the volume than the strain on people he said The computers might turn out to be the heroes of this whole thing added DuWayne Peterson executive vice president of technology at Merrill Lynch and Co Inc In fact officials said the biggest constraint on trading was caused by some of the oldest machines on exchange floors the card printers that issue the buy and sell orders But even as computer executives spoke with awe about their systems' ability to hold up under unprecedented pressure they started to plan for the future We had to do a lot of innovative things to handle this volume said Squyres of the Securities Industry Automation Corp (SIAC) which is jointly owned by the New York and American Stock exchanges SIAC had planned to boost the capacity of its system by up to 50 pct by 1990 But that and other improvements will now be made much earlier Meanwhile New York Telephone Co said Monday's

strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday's US attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag The measure said the attack was a firm indication of US resolve that Iran cannot take military action against the United States with impunity Earlier the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy The measure however does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act which could lead to a pullout of US forces from the Gulf While Democrats and Republicans praised the US retaliatory strike many voiced new fears about the growing US involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act and Poor's Corp said it is reviewing for downgrade

released on Tuesday The ABC-Washington Post poll taken after the close of stock trading on Monday showed 58 pct did not believe the unprecedented slide in stock prices foretold an economic downturn and 70 pct rejected the notion the country faced a 1930s-style Depression Fifty-three pct of those interviewed said they had owned stocks at some point and only one pct said they had sold any as a result of Monday's decline Of the 40 pct who currently held stocks only two pct said they planned to sell some and four pct said they planned to buy The poll of 507 men and women was taken by telephone on Monday night after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 500 points or 22 pct in record volume stock market collapse could spell disaster for Republican hopes of retaining the White House in 1988 -- if it proves to be the start of a general economic downturn -- political experts said The question is does the stock market (decline) signal an impending recession If that is the case the Republicans will have a very difficult time winning independent political analyst William Schneider told If the Democrats nominate anyone halfway credible they would win he added Schneider's comments on the heels of a 500-point decline in the bellwheter Dow Jones stock market average reflected the old political adage that elections are almost always decided by voters' feelings about their financial well being There is no doubt people always vote their pocketbook and we don't expect 1988 to be any different says Donald Foley the top spokesman for Missouri Representative Richard Gephardt's Democratic presidential campaign Foley added that the five-year old stock market rally has shown amazing resilience and there's no telling where the market will be by the end of the week President Reagan said he was puzzled by the day's events but is convinced the economy is fundamentally sound I think everyone is puzzled  because all the business indices are up There is nothing wrong with the economy he told reporters I don't think anyone should panic because all the economic indicators are solid he added But for the time being the decline on Wall Street knocked the underpinnings from his boasts that the record bull market demonstrates the wisdom of current economic policy It could also deprive the Republicans of a major argument for keeping the White House in their hands when President Reagan leaves office in January 1989 It gives a hollow ring to the words used by Vice President George Bush just a week ago when he formally entered the White House race We have weathered the storm Our economy has recovered to be the strongest in history Bush said in reference to the recovery from the 1981-82 recession that pushed unemployment to its highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s We mark next week the longest peacetime economic expansion in our nation's recorded history Bush bragged At midday even as Wall Street was being battered by a record selling panic Reagan gave a glowing account of the economy's performance at a swearing in ceremony for his new Commerce Secretary William Verity Indeed the Labor Department reported earlier this month that unemployment among American workers had fallen to an eight-year low of 59 pct in September compared to seven pct a year ago and a Post World War Two peak of 107 pct in December 1982 But with interest rates climbing steadily and no improvement in the record US trade deficit with the rest of the world a number of economic experts have expressed doubts about the staying power of the current expansion Warnings of economic danger around the corner have been a staple of Democratic campaign speeches this year And Democratic party leaders here for an organizational meeting two weeks ago predicted at that time that the economy would be the determining factor in next year's election The 1988 election will be decided as most peacetime elections are on economic issues said Michigan party chairman Richard Weiner In Ohio people are uneasy They want to know where the economy is going added Ohio Democratic leader James Ruvulo American political history is replete with examples of voters throwing out incumbent officeholders when the economy turns sour -- most notably in 1932 when Democrat Franklin Roosevelt won a landslide triumph that ended 12 years of Republican rule and made the Democrats the nation's majority party for more than 40 years But political experts said that if Monday's stock decline turns out to be a temporary phenomena it will have no effect on the 1988 election Times change conditions change Schneider said Quoting legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel Schneider added Never make predictions especially about the future market analysts polled before Tokyo's market opened on Tuesday said Wall Street's dramatic fall on Monday was overdone and although Tokyo would fall drastically at the opening it might stabilise later Factors affecting the Tokyo market are not the same as those in New York they said Tokyo's market is completely different from New York said a senior analyst at Nomura Securities We have no computer (program) selling and much more stable share ownership than in New York The discount rate in Japan cannot rise the senior Nomura analyst said He said the Tokyo Exchange's 225-share index may fall 1000 points on Tuesday because of basic concern It dropped 62018 points to 2574656 on Monday But he said a 1000 point fall would be nothing compared to New York New York overreacted the dollar is rising -- that should be a positive sign for New York he said The Tokyo Stock Exchange opens from 0900 local time (0000 GMT) to 1500 local (0600 GMT) The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 508 points (or 225 pct) to 1738 on Monday its biggest ever one day decline in both absolute and percentage terms Simon Smithson a Kleinwort Benson International share analyst said Tokyo's market was likely to free fall in morning trading but perhaps would stabilise later He too predicted a drop of perhaps 1000 points in the index today But he said overall economic conditions in the US And Japan were different The problems that pushed down the New York market like the (US) budget deficit trade deficit and slow economic growth do not exist in Japan Smithson said However a stocks fund manager at a major trust bank made a more gloomy prediction The situation is different in the two markets but you cannot ignore New York he said Foreigners will be selling and the index funds will be selling he said A fund manager at another Japanese trust bank said Monday's New York fall was completely out of the range of expectations All we can do is wait now and see what happens There seem to be no factors which would stop the fall There is no way we can invest now he said Manhattan Corp (CMB) president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic conditions If we are right about the fundamentals this thing should settle down Labrecque said at a news conference at the American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause US monetary officials to ease credit policies Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year Labrecque said He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to continue well into 1988 I don't think the stock market will cause a recession Labrecque said He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from the stock market fall would be Chase's stock price however dropped 23 pct but other money center banks suffered even sharper losses Referring to the banking industry he said: We're talking about one day These are strong institutions he said Labrecque said he did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary policy in view of the stock market's behavior If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the other way he said Labrecque said the high US budget deficit was not the single most important factor behind the market's worries He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the United States West Germany Japan and Britain Representative Clayton Yeutter said on Monday that the US free trade agreements with Canada and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the global trading system He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este Uruguay to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it trade in agriculture and services such as banking Yeutter made his remarks at a US-Israeli trade meeting marking the second year of their bilateral accord The Canadian-US pact signed by two sides two weeks ago has yet been approved by the US Congress and Canadian Parliament The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and many services Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli pacts other countries have realized that if they want to continue to have access to the world's largest market they had better get serious about improving the GATT The pact with Israel he said is gradually increasing shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially increase the gross national products in both countries Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should serve as important precedents for progress in GATT Yeutter said increasing trade is one of the keys to enhanced political and economic stability around the globe He said a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity not only for advanced industrial nations but also for other countries that need to increase trade in order to better their standards of living Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to protectionism He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions against nations with large trade surpluses with the United States if the countries practiced unfair trade The legislation was prompted by a growing US trade deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still rising Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to resist but the pending legislation would undermine President Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto He said President Reagan will veto any bill that contains serious flaws and I believe that veto would be sustained Street's biggest one-day drop since 1914 has revived a bitter debate about whether modern investment techniques turn shifts in investor psychology into colossal moves in share prices The market has gotten away from the players said Dudley Eppel vice president-equity trading at Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp He says stock index futures and options have distorted the investment process But Wall Street professionals who work with index futures and options insist the blame is misplaced Fischer Black head of the trading and arbitrage division at Goldman Sachs and Co says so-called program trading strategies involving opposite positions in futures on stock indices and the underlying stocks deserve almost no blame for today's decline People have changed their minds about the future of the economy he said Another strategy known as portfolio insurance may have exagerated the decline to a small degree said Black Eli Wachtel of Bear Stearns and Co was emphatic I do not believe the drop was precipitated by portfolio insurance or expanded by program trading The only thing that will stop it in the end is the value investor who comes in and says 'IBM still sells computers' and buys for traditional reasons said Jeffrey Miller of Miller Tabak Hirsch and Co IBM <IBM> fell 31 to 104 as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 500 points Several years ago Miller's firm was one of the first to pursue program trading strategies seeking to lock in an automatic profit by taking advantage of discrepancies in the prices of the futures and the underlying stocks But he said his firm has not been involved in that since late last year Miller said some investors who were burned in the recent market declines may have miscalculated the effects of portfolio insurance He estimated 70 to 80 billion dlrs in invested funds prior to the decline were hedged with futures The way portfolio insurance is used Miller said investors at the time they protect their portfolios commit themselves to a future course of action such as buying a put option While negative news such as trade deficits and budget deficits build for months the put options tend to be crowded into a narrow span of time because they are executed as the market starts to fall Miller said at present people can only guess how much portfolio insurance is in use He suggested some system of disclosure could put other investors on guard that the seeds were being planted that might add to a future decline But in any case Miller argued that index futures and options do not initiate market trends People like Eppel of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette were steadfast in their criticism If I had my way there wouldn't be any index futures he said They propelled the market up when nothing was going on and now we're paying the price Another irate trader referring to IBM's 31 point drop complained what announcement did IBM make over the weekend that made its stock drop 31 points? IBM was as high as 175-7/8 earlier this year Some economists agreed that the stock market could be sending signals about the economy Allen Sinai chief economist for Shearson Lehman Brothers told the 508 point decline represented a crisis of confidence This is a a bona-fide financial crisis The market is showing panic I suspect there is a wholesale deserting of our markets by a lot of foreign investors Sinai said the crisis was caused by continuing US budget and trade deficits and by rising interest rates This is not a signal of the start of a recession but a strong indicator that one is coming if nothing is done in Washington to deal with the budget and trade deficits Sinai said Some market participants said redemptions by investors who own mutual funds fueled the decline But Steve Norwitz a spokesman for T Rowe Price Associates a Baltimore-based investment management firm said redemptions and switches into money market funds by Price's one mln accounts amounted to less than two pct of assets It's not a rout by any means Norwitz said the company normally receives about 3500 telephone inquiries from its customers each day On Friday he said when the Dow index fell 108 points the volme of calls rose to around 7000 and today it exceeded that although he did not have a precise number Ike Kerridge an economist with the oilfield service firm Baker Hughes Inc was one of several analysts who said the evaporation of billions of dollars of paper profits could alter consumer behavior This could be the trigger for a national recession which would be very unusual in an election year Kerridge said of a meeting between US Treasury Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets allowing the dollar to recoup much of the day's losses dealers said News of the meeting which took place in Frankfurt in great secrecy came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by Baker of West German monetary policy which had provoked fears that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy The dollar reacted immediately to the news rising over two pfennigs in after hours New York trading dealers there said The announcement of the meeting also attended by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl was made simultaneously in Bonn and Washington timed for after the closure of New York markets Baker Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the February Louvre accord a finance ministry spokesman in Bonn said The dollar rose to 17970/90 marks from New York's close of 17730/40 It had closed there on Friday at 17975/85 marks The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest rates and stock markets crashed worldwide Baker had said that West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord Under the accord leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability with the surplus countries West Germany and Japan stimulating their economies and the US promising to cut its budget deficit West German government sources said rising West German money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre pact They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the United States US Bond yields have been rising since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed raised the discount rate to 600 pct from 550 German yields have also risen over this period but less markedly and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up short-term rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts its principal instrument for steering the money market The allocation rate on the last facility was 385 pct compared with 360 pct This was partly due to West Germany's inability to uncouple itself from US interest rate trends but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth which raised fears of domestically produced inflation bank economists said This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally to the more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger In an apparent gesture to Baker coinciding with his visit the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease US anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much under American fire said Chris Zwermann currency adviser at Swiss Bank Corp here It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a significant retreat from its position added Giles Keating economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact on Tuesday and its result on Wednesday money market economists said Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation rate which is likely to turn out at between 380 and 390 pct little changed from the 385 pct on the last facility The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place although the Finance Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman asked to comment on the apparent US-German clash over the Louvre accord went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West Germany for Sweden on Monday This week he is also due to visit Denmark and Belgium global crude oil reserves and the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send the world into an energy crisis by 1990 the former Atlantic Richfield Co chairman Robert O Anderson said It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks Anderson told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch I believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find Anderson who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil and Gas Co said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about 45 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear If you looked around the world you could not scrape up one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle East he said We're soon going to be right back where we were in 1973 and 1979 Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't enough supply he said There have been no major oil discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves the last major world discovery has already produced about five billion barrels of oil or more than half of its estimated reserves he said Ravi Batra whose book warning of a crash on Wall Street has been a best seller all summer said Monday's record-breaking market drop was no reason to panic I think (investors) should stay in the market Don't panic The time to panic is two years from now Batra a professor at Southern Methodist University told by telephone from Pittsburgh where he was to deliver a lecture at Rockwell International Corp Batra's book The Great Depression of 1990 predicts that the increasing concentration of US wealth will lead to a depression He said Monday's 508-point drop was set off by last week's news of the trade deficit and other things that added to the total jitters However he called the fall a mini-crash due in part to a change in people's attitude to the market In the 1920s people thought the market would never come down he said But today people think it will come down at some point and therefore when it does everyone wants to get out It turns a mini-crash into a maxi-crash he said but added that he did not see it falling any further He said he expects the government to announce by the end of the week an agreement with Japan and West Germany to bring interest rates down Once (interest rates) come down the market will calm down he said adding the government had other options such as acting on program trading that it might be able to use to stabilize the market But in two year's time the government will run out of options he added discovery of a fertile female Mediterranean fruit fly in a backyard apple tree may lead to aerial spraying in Orange County California State Department of Agriculture officials said California Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Gera Curry said more than 1700 traps have been set in an 80-square mile area around the Westminster neighborhood following the discovery The fly was found in a trap routinely checked by agriculture officials Curry said if aerial spraying is used it would be one-time spray unlike the nightly sprayings used in 1980 Japanese investment in US real estate will continue despite a weak dollar because such investments are strong hedges against inflation financiers and real estate industry experts said Addressing a conference on Japanese investment in US real estate Setsuya Tabuchi chairman of Nomura Securities Co Ltd said Japanese investors are extremely cautious about investing in Treasury securities because of currency losses suffered in the past during the dollar's sharp decline But he added Real estate is a hedge against inflation so such investment will not decline Japanese total investment in US real estate last year is estimated at around six billion dlrs exceeding the four billion dlrs ploughed into US equities Arther Mitchell of Coudert Brothers a US law firm told the conference Adding in financing of real estate projects by Japanese banks and leasing companies the total aamount of Japanese funds committed to US real estate projects could reach 20 billion dlrs in 1987 he said The dollar's fall has made US property cheap and exchange risks are low because many Japanese firms are making investments projected on a dollar/yen rate of 120-130 he said Panelists at the conference said Japanese are now looking at a wider variety of real estate investments including development projects and suburban buildings Benjamin Lambert chairman of Eastdil Realty Inc said the sale of 50 pct of the company to Nomura last year was designed

secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary General had no comment on the attack which followed his appeal last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq In his explanation Walters said the United States took defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against American ships in the Gulf He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle City Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations (Charter) I wish on behalf of my government to report that United States forces have exercised the inherent right of self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action in response to attacks by    Iran against United States vessels in the Gulf Walters said Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war but no statement was issued afterwards voiced its comprehension for a US Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to the Gulf War to avoid further escalation The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all states to take action under international law and the United Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16 the Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a US-flagged Kuwaiti ship Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping The French statement described the target as an Iranian military platform But the French statement added that everything must be done now to avoid

four mln transactions are expected to be processed for Chrysler each year under the contract lawmakers rallied behind President Reagan for the US strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress debate over limits on his powers to make war The Pentagon announced on Monday that US warships destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf ship traffic and military operations and also raided a second Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag Many Democrats who control Congress and Republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate measured response But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States could erupt into a major war and demanded that Reagan comply with the 1973 War Powers Act which could lead to a pullout of American forces from the waterway Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war with Iran said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon a Republican Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz met for an hour with Vice President George Bush on Monday after US naval forces destroyed one Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and raided another Asked at the start of the meeting how he felt about the attack the Crown Prince who is here on an official visit replied I believe what the United States has done is their responsibility as a superpower His remark appeared to be an implicit endorsement of the US action which the Pentagon said came in retaliation for last Friday's Iranian missile attack on a US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Administration officials said Bush had assured the Crown Prince the United States would stay the course in the Gulf They said Prince Abdullah who is deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia and commander of the kingdom's national guard was very supportive of the US role in the strategic waterway Before meeting with Bush the Crown Prince paid a brief courtesy call on President Reagan During his stay in Washington he was also scheduled to meet with Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leaders of the House and Senate foreign policy committees US Food and Drug Administration has allowed ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc to resume testing its ribavirin experimental AIDS drug according to ICN Our safety concerns are not of sufficient magnitude to withhold approval of further clinical studies designed to assess the safety and efficacy of ribavirin the FDA told ICN Chairman Milan Panic in an October 16 letter made public by ICN An FDA spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the letter ICN's tests of the drug on humans were blocked last spring after the FDA decided there was insufficient evidence of its effectiveness against two common AIDS-related conditions The tests had been intended to determine whether ribavirin was effective against AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) and Lymphadenopathy Syndrome or LAS FDA Commissioner Frank Young disclosed in May however that the agency was investigating suspicious test results submitted by ICN on the antiviral drug Young said he had personally scolded ICN officials for making exaggerated claims about the drug In addition a House subcommittee said it was probing ICN for possible trading or financial irregularities Today the FDA said it was letting ICN test ribavirin for safety and effectiveness in 32 patients with ARC and LAS

closed half an hour early under a pile of unfilled orders on heavy but not record volume of over 11 mln shares Exchange officials said As traders remained on the floors in San Francisco and Los Angeles madly trying to balance their accounts long after the close Exchange Chairman Maurice Menn told a news conference trading will nevertheless begin on time tomorrow at 0630 Pacific Daylight Time Menn told reporters the price of a seat on the exchange dropped to 86000 dlrs today from 100100 dlrs a week ago Menn said the day also saw 134000 options contracts traded compared to a record 202000 contracts last friday Traders both in Los Angeles and San Francisco said volume was curbed purely by their inability to fill orders and the chaos created by the exchange tape falling hours behind making it nearly impossible to get accurate price readings If we would have been able to execute the orders we got there would have been 20 mln shares traded said Richard Goforth a partner with Crowell Weedon and Co who trades on the Los Angles floor of the Pacific Exchange Traders in San Francisco said there were unconfirmed reports that one brokerage house alone turned away orders for 50000 shares they were unable to fill in late trading The traders and exchange officials said action on the Pacific Exchange did not deviate from that in New York with some early buying giving way to panic selling through the close which left the Dow Jones Industrial Average down a record 508 points We pretty much mirrored what was going on in New York they couldn't fill their orders and we knew we couldn't fill them either said Goforth While traders said they are bracing themselves for a lower opening tomorrow Mann attributed today's dive to panicking young traders and to monetary policy and

statement issued after a cabinet meeting said Goria had been informed by the United States that it would take action against an Iranian target in the Gulf but had not known beforehand that the action would involve an attack on an oil platform The prime minister expressed his concern over the possible consequences of increased tension in the Gulf at the same time recognizing the limited character of the American military reaction to the attacks it has suffered in the past few days the statement said Goria said Italy's own ships were far from the platform at the time of the attack and the fleet had been advised to follow events with caution Italy has sent eight ships including three frigates and three minesweepers to the Gulf to protect Italian merchant shipping there and Poor's Corp said it

After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing short-term money market interest rates He had said the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilizing the US dollar last February The meeting had been arranged last week the spokesman said Baker Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency stability and monetary policy Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into the West German money market in a move which money market dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary authority to curb interest rate rises The spokesman described Monday's talks which he called private as very positive bank executives said if the precipitous fall in the stock market continued it could force banks to demand more

The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote virtually snuffing out US soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year A similar proposal has made no headway in the House Sen Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package I don't see this as a trade issue I see it as giving American consumers the information they need he said Proponents of the measure including the American Soybean Association have claimed palm palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease The US soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils imported primarily from Malaysia Indonesia and the Philippines But Sen Richard Lugar (R-Ind) read a letter from US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter who said the proposal blatantly discriminates against imports would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils The committee voted largely along party lines with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure Knudsen Corp in its third quarter earnings report released today

chairman John Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction today but he did not characterize it as a crash He also said the NYSE will open tomorrow on time The market underwent a

going up for five years without a correction He also blamed inflation fears rising interest rates a lower dollar and problems with Iran All came together in a very nervous market he said It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to see Phelan said Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a snowballing effect where selling fed on itself Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard procedures before trading begins tomorrow Those procedures include checking with member firms on their liquidity margin positions and backlog We know of no firm that has a significant problem but that could change at any moment he said Asked for advice for the average investor Phelan said We do not know where the market will end up The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508 points to 173874 Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares almost double the previous record Phelan in response to a question on declines in foreign markets said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the global economy He added that the underlying fundamentals of the US economy are still strong and that corporate earnings also continue to be firm Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result of a confluence of factors including the globalization of markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile he said Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull market He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in all trading on the exchange Phelan said The consensus was that it is better to let the market try to work itself out he said In addition Phelan said that with the global nature of trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose Phelan said he was in contact with the Treasury department White House and the Federal Reserve but that the contact was made as a matter of routine Treasury Secretary James Baker met West

consult with leading financial experts including the chairmen of the Federal Reserve the Securities and Exchance Commission and the New York Stock Exchange These consultations confirm our view that the underlying economy remains sound Fitzwater said The White House statement issued about 45 minutes after the stock market closed appeared designed to calm investors worried about US economic propects We are in the longest peacetime expansion in history Employment is at the highest level ever Manufacturing output is up The trade deficit when adjusted for changes in currencies is steadily improving And as the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board has recently stated there is no evidence of a resurgence of inflation in the United States Fitzwater said He said Reagan was keeping close

statement gave no hint of what if any action Reagan might take if the stock market plunge continues The percentage drop of 226 percent on Monday was the second largest ever exceeded only by the 244 percent drop on Dec 12 1914 It easily eclipsed the fall of 128 percent on Oct 28 1929 which helped spark the Great Depression Reagan and his top advisers discussed the market crisis which came on the

agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on US Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones the spokesman said Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming US Manufacturers It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France Britain West Germany and Spain the countries involved in the

crisis The United States is fully entitled to take military action in exercise of rights of self-defense in the face of the imminent threat of further attacks Howe said in a statement issued in London The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a US- flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday Referring to that attack Howe added I trust the Iranians will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of European Community (EC) ministers Howe was asked about statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was now involved in a full-scale war It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified

establish price ceilings for ATT long-distance services as a replacement for current regulation The company was responding to an FCC proposal of August 4 that price caps replace the current rate-of-return regulation which has been in place for the past 20 years ATT said vigorous competition in the long-distance industry has made obsolete rate-of-return which stipulates that a company can earn no more than a fixed rate -- currently 122 pct -- on its investment The company termed the price cap a transitional step and said it hoped the FCC would support a program of regulatory oversight which would consist of a streamlined tariff process Industries Inc said its board authorized management to buy back up to four mln common shares or 157 pct of the AFG stock outstanding from time to

for use with stock option plans Morgan and Co Inc said third-quarter net income rose 36 pct to 2192 mln dlrs from 2115 mln a year earlier partly because of reduced loan-loss provisions and a lower income tax bill For the first nine months of the year however Morgan posted a loss of 1408 mln dlrs compared with a profit of 6824 mln in the same period of 1986 because it set aside 875 mln dlrs in reserves in the second quarter against shaky third-world loans The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 20 mln dlrs down from 70 mln a year earlier Morgan's tax bill was 524 mln dlrs in the quarter down from 853 mln a year earlier mainly because of benefits associated with the second-quarter loan-loss provision Net interest earnings fell to 4743 mln dlrs from 5265 mln as net yield narrowed to 271 pct from 313 pct and 13 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans remained on non-accrual Non-interest operating income was 296 mln dlrs up from 2928 mln Net charge-offs halved to 16 mln dlrs

structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four US Destroyers pumped some 1000 shells into it The US Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained US helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and US forces attacked seized and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines But Iran was not deterred according to US defense officials who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a US-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran Henry Schuler a former US diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of US intervention and Iran's response The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a US tit-for-tat policy that gave Iran the initiative said Harlan Ullman an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS He said with this appraoch America would suffer the death of one thousand cuts But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass Schuler said He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table If vital supplies were cut off Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980 Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties Each side has attacked the others' shipping US attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies Western diplomats in the region said US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that US Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday We consider the matter closed he said a signal the US administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis saying military action would endanger American interests Following the raid a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a crushing blow The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely Tehran Radio quoted him as saying Diplomats noted however Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering they said The ball is in Iran's court now It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other a diplomat said President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation one diplomat said This was better for US Relations with the Gulf Arab states particularly Kuwait Commented another diplomat: Kuwait must be happy that the US Has done something but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep One source said of the attack on the oil platform: They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody A diplomat commented: They were very clever in the place they chose It gets attention but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: This was a good measured response without risking a flare-up  It is a face-saving

destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a US-flagged tanker The experts told Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors blockading its shipping or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues said Fred Axelgard a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) It's like a Greek tragedy said retired Adm Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area where the Navy began escorting US-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran which President Reagan could never accept US Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd Young Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the US-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said We consider this matter closed he said Analysts ranging from the liberal

analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank said OPEC production could be about 185-190 mln in October and International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September production at 185 mln bpd The US Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the US Flag the Sea Isle City It was struck by a missile believed to be Iranian in Kuwaiti waters and was the first hit on a US Flag commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war The US Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the area on Thursday also believed struck by an Iranian missile Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the US Attack analysts said They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz through which around eight mln bpd passes isnlikely because it is not in the interests of the US Or Iran they said Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf hostilities analysts said But they saw the US Strike as a limited reply to Iranian missile attacks with some describing it as responsible Geoffrey Pyne analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew said he was impressed by the sensible US Response The US Has thought carefully about what would correspond to Iranian agression They have proved to the Iranians that any further action will be met with a like-for-like response Today's action by the US Was not escalatory Pyne said Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the US Strike was a responsible retaliation with the US Apparently indicating to Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran chose to raise the level of conflict Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view however He said he was unable to see what the US Had achieved as Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia whose interests the US Is supposedly defending will feel less secure as a result of the US Attack and fear some sort of Iranian retaliation The initial upward market move this morning reflected a strong speculative reaction to rumours of a US Attack which was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile launchers on the Faw

and will soon begin showing improvement The stage I think is being set for a healthy constructive expansion without inflationary instability he said Swiss Banking Commission hopes to introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual liquidity requirements Commission Director Kurt Hauri told the main consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in interest rates which occurs at the end of every month By effectively reducing liquidity requirements it would also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain West Germany and the United States he said The commission wants to move to a system of average liquidity requirements where banks have to hold reserves equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated over the month as a whole The current system described as a Swiss special case by Hauri forces banks to comply with requirements generally only at the end of each month The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money market rates overshadowed by the approach of the end-month called the ultimo with consequent high costs for the banks who are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when overnight rates hit triple figures due to a combination of the half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its money supply target Although the rise shocked the bank into more flexibility the problem remained The reform proposal which Hauri said had been planned for years was given to banks and other interested parties for comment on September 30 They have until the end of this month to suggest alterations Subject to such changes and to the government go-ahead it will come into force on January 1

Donna Smith a Monsanto spokeswoman The company reported third quarter sales of 190 billion dlrs from 169 billion a year earlier Nutrasweet sales fell to 177 mln from 179 mln a year earlier it said A growing market for diet sodas about 90 pct of which use Nutrasweet offset much of the sales loss said Monsanto chief economist Nick Filippello Prospects remain strong in the diet soda market Filippello said since industry analysts predict diet carbonated soft drinks will hold about 28 pct of the soda market by year's end up from 25 pct in 1986 That market coupled with increased usage of Nutrasweet in such items as frozen desserts should result in a 10 pct increase in consumer consumption of the sweetener in 1987 Filippello said Monsanto spokeswoman Donna Smith refused to comment on the company's pricing policies for Nutrasweet However Filippello said it was fair to assume that Monsanto priced Nutrasweet at a lower rate for the diet soda market Nutrasweet sales have been falling

African investment reversal of investment tax credits and othe4r items Louvre accord on currency stability which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil foreign exchange dealers said But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive US Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan who both have large trade surpluses pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the US While the US Agreed to stop talking the dollar down However Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative the West German interest rate move would force the US To re-examine the accord The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany  He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation Chris Johns currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view telling that the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur who hosted the Louvre meeting was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks He called for a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord In Frankfurt F Wilhelm Christians joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank said that following recent meetings with Baker he believed that the US Was still committed to the accord In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 380 pct on Monday down from the 385 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after

will rush to borrow before rates increase further Corporate treasurers will continue to issue new debt when they believe they are borrowing at an attractive rate said an underwriter with a major Wall Street house Said another We will not see a flood of new offerings Treasurers are reassessing the market We will not see new issuance dry up either Still the pace of corporate borrowing in the public finance market has slowed according to a tabulation Last week which was shortened by the Columbus Day holiday saw issuance of 13 billion dlrs of new debt That was down from the prior week's tally of slightly more than two billion dlrs of new debt In contrast a year ago it was not unusual to see those amounts of new offerings in a single day as companies took advantage of the then decline in interest rates to refinance old higher-cost debt or to expand operations via financings at low attractive rates underwriters noted Companies will conduct financings that they believe are essential said an underwriter with a medium-sized Wall Street firm But we will not see much more than that until the market stabilizes In the meantime treasurers will probably prefer shorter term issues analysts said For instance of last week's nine issues only one had a maturity of more than 10 years The other offerings had maturities of two to seven years with most clustered in the two to three year area according to a tabulation That is because single-digit interest rates were had last week only among two-year securities If people think that interest rates will continue to head higher then we could see treasurers rushing to market said a trader with a medium-sized securities house But if people think last week's sharp interest rate rise is a fluke treasurers will sit back and wait for rates to decline before issuing new debt hoping of course that they are not missing the boat by doing so she added Another impediment to new issuance is the lukewarm reception to new issues by institutional and retail investors in recent weeks traders pointed out Many investors refrained from buying because they believed rate would rise further We saw a lot of buying interest last week but people are not yet willing to pull the trigger a broker said They would rather wait and see if the recent rate increase can be sustained Conflicting forecasts on the likely direction of interest rates did not help analysts said For instance Henry Kaufman chief economist with Salomon Brothers Inc said in his weekly Comments on Credit that the yields of US Treasury bonds would probably rise further because the marketplace expects inflation to rise and the dollar to continue to decline In contrast Standard and Poor's Corp said on Friday that prices of debt securities in the fixed-income markets would recover The rating agency said neither the economy nor the dollar justify current high yields Meanwhile the Chicago Board of Trade is slated to hold a press briefing on Tuesday in New York about its plans to list a futures contract based on a corporate bond index That follows last week's announcement by Commodity Exchange Inc Comex that it plans to list on October 29 a new futures contract

sharp rise in interest rates However Seidman attending the American Bankers Association convention said he did not expect rates to rise much higher and said the outlook for the US economy and for banking was sound The potential for greater interest rate rises gives us concern We see nothing right now in the outlook that causes us to believe rates are going much higher or that the economy is not sound Seidman told a news conference Steel Co said it and the USS Division of USX Corp <X> are continuing to pursue plans for construction of a state-of-the-art line for continuous prepainting of

averaged 43 pct fat or less well below American Heart Association guidelines for recommended foods Eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat the NPPC said Meanwhile USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the established authority on nutrient composition indicates a fat content for center loin pork of 73 pct the NPPC said Robin Kline a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy between the study and the USDA handbook Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information that has been accumulated over the past 30 years The statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices Kline said The study funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories from 07 to 13 inches of backfat Researchers

said  We consider this matter is now closed Weinberger said four US destroyers attacked the platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire at 0700 EDT Weinberger said We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with and be a source of potential attack on convoys Weinberger said at a Pentagon briefing We know it has been used indeed to not only launch small boat attacks on shipping but to fire on US helicopters It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of US forces in the future Weinberger said of the US Navy's operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran with stronger countermeasures Weinberger said He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform As far as we know they did abandon the site he said Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack profit 10 cts vs profit eight cts Net profit 477853 vs profit 348384 Sales 177

elapsed since our original proposal was submitted the credit and financial markets have experienced extraordinary and almost unprecedented deterioration As of the present time the average interest rate on the financing which we proposed to raise in connection with the acquisition has increased since the original proposal by approximately 150 basis points He said the group intends to promptly

accords on currency stability by all major industrial countries Balladur responding to weekend remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the US Would take another look at the accords said I firmly desire a faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit On Sunday Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords The Louvre accords agreed in Paris last February called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them he added warned the United States on Monday against exacerbating the Gulf crisis saying it would endanger American interests Tehran Radio monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation said a spokesman for Iran's War Information Headquarters was responding to US Officials' remarks about taking military action against Iran The radio also quoted an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying Iran would respond decisively to any aggressive measure by the United States The radio said the spokesman made the statement following the attack on a Kuwaiti ship under the US Flag and comments by American officials on carrying out retaliatory action against Iran The spokesman said Any US Military aggression against Iran will certainly be the beginning of an extensive clash in the Persian Gulf and amidst this our principled policy is to confront any act which escalates tension West German Finance Ministry declined to comment on weekend criticism by US Treasury Secretary James Baker of recent West German interest rate increases Baker said the US Would re-examine the February Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies reached by leading industrial democracies The rise in West Germany short term interest rates was not in the spirit of an agreement by these nations in Washington which reaffirmed the Louvre pact he said A Finance Ministry spokesman asked for an official ministry reaction to Baker's remarks said he could make no comment Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added Airlines Inc said Frontier Airlines which it bought last year has sought approval from the US Bankruptcy court here to pay up to 19 mln dlrs in employee medical dental and other benefit claims on an expedited basis Continental is itself owned by Texas Air Corp <TEX> Some 12 mln dlrs of the claims would be paid directly to former Frontier employees for medical expenses incurred prior to and immediately after Fronter filed for bankrupcty and ceased operations in August last year President Ali Khamenei said he doubted the US Was in position to take violent action against Iran in the Gulf Tehran Radio reported The US Government is in a very difficult situation now and it is not clear if it has the necessary elements for a violent action the radio quoted him as saying in an interview with the English language daily Tehran Times In Washington President Ronald Reagan said he had decided on a response to Iran which the Americans blame for two missile attacks on US-related tankers in Kuwaiti waters last week but declined to say what the response was Khamenei said the US Government had to take some action to demonstrate its authority but on the other hand any violent act in the Persian Gulf will greatly harm long-term US Interests the radio monitored in Nicosia reported On efforts for a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war Khamenei said: Declaration of the aggressor and a ceasefire should be concurrent Formation of a panel to determine the aggressor necessarily preceeds the ceasefire He also rejected a peace-keeping committee or a buffer force as instruments to implement a July 20 UN Security Council order for a ceasefire in the seven-year-old Gulf war Ministry of Finance has started to consider the coupon rate of the 10-year government bond issue for November a Ministry official said The underwriting syndicate may want a rise in the coupon rate by nearly one point from the current 49 pct he said But bond traders see a rise to about 56 pct as most likely Ministry officials will try to keep the rate low to meet US Requests for maintenance of the interest rate differential between the US And Japan the Ministry official told Plans for an October issue were cancelled when the Ministry and the bond underwriting syndicate failed to reach agreement on terms The underwriting syndicate will start negotiating with the Finance Ministry on the terms of the November issue after any changes in the prime rate for November are decided which should be by the end of this week an underwriting source said Cancellation of the November bond issue is not out of the question he said adding that negotiations are expected to be difficult announcement by Alliant Computer Systems Inc <ALNT> of a new low-end near-supercomputer and <ETA Systems Inc>'s unveiling of a high-end machine in the same category show competition is stiff in this market industry analysts said Consultants said Alliant's new FX computer aimed mainly at scientists and researchers will be priced between 100000 and 200000 dlrs and will be faster than anything else in that price range But they said Alliant is trying to bring prices in line with discounts it now gives many of its customers (The new FX) is significant to the extent that it represents Alliant's recognition of the reality of the marketplace said a source who was briefed by Alliant on the new computer The list price is more in line with what they are seeing anyway Near-supercomputers often called mini-supercomputers resemble the massive supercomputers favoured by scientists but are much less expensive and a quarter as powerful Supercomputers cost well over one mln dlrs but mini-supercomputers are generally priced between 200000 dlrs and one mln dlrs Most near-supercomputers use a new computer architecture called parallel processing in which a problem is broken up into segments and each segment assigned to a different processor General-purpose mainframe computers have just one processor that works on one segment of a problem at a time making them too slow for complex scientific problems Near-supercomputers have been in existence for only about five years and the two leading manufacturers Alliant and Convex Computer Corp (CNVX) held two of the most successful initial public offerings last year But Alliant and Convex a Texas company are also facing some 15 companies competing for between 200 and 250 mln dlrs in sales this year and the result has been lower prices and shrinking profit margins Heavy discounting slow acceptance outside the scientific market lack of software and too many competitors also have made analysts reassess prospects for near-supercomputers Jeffrey Canin computer analyst with Hambrecht and Quist said he just added a year to his original growth estimates for the industry He now expects sales to reach 11 billion dlrs in 1991 instead of 1990 In recent weeks both Alliant and Convex have said their third quarter earnings would be reduced by competitive pricing pressures Alliant said profits for the period will be about five cents a share against eight cents last year although revenues for the period rose to 142 mln dlrs from 86 mln Convex said third quarter earnings will be less than the second quarter's 12 cents a share while revenues will rise almost eight mln dlrs over the 1986 third quarter to between 18 and 185 mln dlrs Until now most of the price discounting occurred at the bottom of the product line in near-supercomputers but ETA System's announcement could start squeezing Convex and Alliant from the top analysts said ETA a subsidiary of Control Data Corp <CDC> introduced two machines that are really full-blown supercomputers similar to those sold by Cray Research Inc the world's biggest supercomputer maker but at half the price of Cray's cheapest model The ETA-10 Model P costs 995000 dlrs and the Model Q is 12 mln dlrs ETA officials told a news conference the new machines may be classified as supercomputers but they are aimed directly at the upper end of the product lines from Alliant and Convex Acceptance of ETA's product could be hampered by lack of software analysts said noting this is an issue that faces all parallel processor makers to some degree Because parallel processing is a new architecture that has yet to be widely used third party software vendors have been slow to write programs for the near-supercomputers ETA however offers a low priced entry into supercomputers for some customers one consultant said Canin cautioned that the price pressures will continue for some time and estimated that five percentage points have been knocked off the gross profit margins of both Convex and Alliant this year by price discounting Next year he said the two companies will face a new set of problems as they both introduce their second generation of products I am always cautious about the first major product transition foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the US Dollar will drop below the significant 14000 yen level dealers said The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range If the currency breaks through this level it may decline sharply said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division The dollar was at 14110 yen at midday against Friday closes of 14235/45 in New York and 14135 here The dollar opened at 14095 yen and fell to a low of 14040 It was 17733/38 marks against 17975/85 in New York and 18008/13 here on Friday after an opening 17700/10 The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by US Treasury Secretary James Baker dealers said The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker's comments said Dai-ichi's Tanaka He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in US Bond prices dealers said Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge US Trade deficit Tanaka said US August trade data showed the US Deficit at a still massive 1568 billion dlrs But if West Germany raises interest rates this would run counter to the pledge he said Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention said Soichi Hirabayashi deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange department The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 14000 to 16000 yen dealers said The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively Hirabayashi said He said the US Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon American Stock Exchange said it has introduced options with expirations of up to three years on the Institutional Index With the ticker symbol <XII> the index is a guage of the core equity holdings of the nation's largest institutions the exchange explained The new listings represent the first

ussr,The Norwegian company <Konsgberg Vaapenfabrikk> (KV) may have sold more high technology defence equipment since an original deal in 1982 senior justice officials said State prosecutor Tor-Aksel Busch told he had started fresh investigations into the state-owned arms firm which delivered computers to the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1983 used to make near-silent submarine propellers There may have been other deliveries of the same equipment since then he said has resumed repairs of Soviet ships after a 23 year break caused by the ideological split between the two countries The New China News Agency said an agreement to resume the business was signed by the two sides on Wednesday in Shanghai where three Soviet commercial vessels were being repaired The China Daily said the first two Soviet ships to be repaired in China since 1964 left the ports of Dalian and Xingang last month Bi Yueran managing director of China State Shipbuilding Corp's ship repair department told the newspaper the Soviet Union lacked adequate repair facilities for the more than 600 ships deployed in the far east Bi said China's yards offered competitive prices guaranteed quality and prompt delivery and wet weather in northern western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year for platinum could reach 34 mln ounces by 1991 compared with an estimated offtake of 288 mln in 1986 Chris Clark platinum marketing director for Johnson Matthey Plc said Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250000 ounce increase in consumption for use in autocatalysts currently the largest single application for platinum Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70000 ounces Clark predicted in his speech the text of which was released in London today Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further increase in investment buying and may well be cautious He said South Africa was the most likely source of additional supplies and will need to increase output by about 500000 ounces to meet increased demand The capital investment required to produce the additional output would be around one billion US Dlrs and the political climate may make it difficult to raise the money he said The Soviet Union whose exports have declined since the 1970s might increase sales to the West by about 50000 ounces Clark said The very probability of a growth in demand set against the massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially underpinned in the medium to long-term Clark said Pentagon has stopped approving any new military contracts to Japan's Toshiba Corp <TSBAT> over a Toshiba subsidiary's transfer of submarine technology to the Soviet Union a senior defense official said We are not approving any new contracts (with Toshiba) pending a satisfactory resolution of this entire matter Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Stephen Bryen told confirming published reports on the matter The temporary ban which Bryen said has been in effect unofficially since April could cost Toshiba hundreds of mlns of dlrs in electronics business with the Pentagon including a pending 100 mln dlr Air Force deal for small computers Bryen said the US military services have not signed any contracts with Toshiba since April when publicity arose over subsidiary Toshiba Machine Co's alleged sale to Moscow of milling machines which will grind silent submarine propellers The Japanese government has been investigating the case and it was previously reported that Toshiba Machine sold four large milling machines to the Soviet Union in late 1983 or early 1984 But Bryen told in an interview that the Pentagon has now been informed by Japanese police that at least four more smaller machines capable of making such precision propellers were also sold to the Kremlin apparently in 1984 There may be even more beyond that I don't know yet Bryen said Toshiba is known to be seeking a US Air Force contract for 90000 lap-top computers worth some 100 mln dlrs The Air Force has called for new bids on that contract partly because of the Toshiba investigation Pentagon officials said The officials who asked not to be identified said the computer contract is also being re-advertised for bidding because of changes in the dlr-yen ratio and questions raised by US import restrictions on some Japanese micro-electronics Two days ago three US senators said they wanted a temporary ban on all US imports of Toshiba Corp products including television sets and videotape recorders Senators Jake Garn of Utah Richard Shelby of Alabama and John Heinz of Pennslvania said they might seek an amendment to a major trade bill being considered by the Senate this summer The Navy is reported to be furious over the technology transfer and Pentagon officials have told that some of the state-of-the-art propellers have already been mounted on Soviet attack submarines The Japanese government has already prohibited Toshiba Machine Co from doing any business with the Soviet Bloc for one year The Norweigan state-own firm Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk was involved in the original technology transfer providing vital computer software to be used with the Japanese milling equipment But the Norweigan firm is now being reorganized and Bryen said that it apparently was not involved in the alleged more recent transfer of Toshiba Machine equipment appear slim for a summer meeting between US and Soviet officials before the two countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains agreement Agriculture Department officials said The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up to last February However any delay this year should not endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends through September 1988 USDA officials said It will be difficult to pull together the people for the meeting during July an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said Since the last meeting was only around four months ago the next talks could still be a couple more months he said There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next marketing year But USDA officials said even if consultations were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer or before the next agreement year begins a USDA source said Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next year's crops he said There are too many variables now It would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now Under the nonbinding pact Moscow has agreed to purchase a minimum of nine mln tonnes of US grain per year Soviet and US officials normally meet in the summer before the start of a new agreement year to discuss grain quality shipping logistics and production outlooks and West on Monday decided to go ahead with an ambitious nuclear fusion project billed as possibly providing an inexhaustible source of energy the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Representatives of the US The Soviet Union the European Community and Japan agreed to develop plans for a revolutionary thermonuclear reactor to produce energy not from splitting atoms as in today's nuclear plants but by joining them Work is due to begin next year at the Institute for Plasma Physics at the Max Planck Foundation near Munich West Germany and is scheduled for completion by 1990 an IAEA statement said Research into fusion's scientific feasibility has been under way for many years but the project approved on Monday known as International Thremonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) will study if an actual plant could be built The project represents an unprecedented display of East-West scientific cooperation but a decision will not be made until its completion on whether an actual reactor would be jointly constructed or by individual participant countries Dieter Sigmar a leading US Fusion researcher said last month that the development of a demonstration plant would cost several billion dlrs and need at least another 10 years Fusion plants would produce little radioactive waste While today's nuclear power plants need uranium mined in only a few countries and producing dangerous waste fusion plants would eventually run only on deuterium an element related to hydrogen and available from almost limitless supplies of sea water according to experts Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a US wheat subsidy offer and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the US/Soviet summit expected to be held next month Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told In an exclusive interview with Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made Last year it was well into the year before we offered it There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy) When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a US/Soviet summit Lyng said No I don't think so I don't think that The Agriculture Secretary said a US wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about Lyng said When Mr Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here  he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States He said it's not presidential Lyng said Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow The future of the US/Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year Lyng said but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement  We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union but do we need a long-term agreement Who benefits from that These are some of the questions we need to discuss When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement Lyng said I don't know It certainly hasn't been what we had hoped it would be For three years running they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement circulated among the trade this morning that the USSR may have purchased between one and two mln tonnes of US corn but there was no confirmation One dealer said he felt some business had been done but that the amount probably was on the low end of trade estimates and the Soviet Union have provisionally agreed to hold talks on a possible exchange of Iranian crude oil for finished Soviet oil products an official spokesman said Tuesday Gennady Gerasimov chief of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Information Directorate told reporters the agreement had been reached during a visit to Moscow last week by Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh Gerasimov said no date had been set for the talks which would also study the possibility of Soviet technical assistance for Iran's oil industry Soviet oil production target for 1988 has been set at 625 mln tonnes a rise of eight mln tonnes over this year's planned output Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday at the Supreme Soviet the country's nominal parliament He said a new development strategy fuller use of oil deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation which began in late 1983 Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil slightly short of the target of 6167 mln January-September figures released at the weekend showed Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467 mln tonnes The 1987 target is 617 million Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil deposits in the coming year He called for speedier geolog prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988 budget and plan The session is expected to end on Tuesday exporters reported sales of 125000 tonnes of US corn to the Soviet Union for delivery during the 1987/88 season and under the fifth year of the Long Term Grain Supply Agreement The department noted the sales are the first reported for delivery during the fifth year of the Agreement which began October 1 1987 Sales of wheat and corn to the USSR for delivery during the fourth year of the agreement totaled 8182500 tonnes -- 4080500 tonnes of wheat and 4102300 tonnes of corn In addition sales of soybeans totaled 68200 tonnes it said Reagan said the Commerce Department should be vigilant in preventing the flow of strategic technology from reaching the the Soviet Union and other communist countries He was speaking at the swearing in of C William Verity as Secretary of the Commerce Department Verity said the US should make certain that militarily sensitive high technology does not wind up in communist nations But he also said the US must reduce the list of products of a nontechnological nature thereby allowing manufacturers to increase exports and jobs announcements from Moscow of next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes Agriculture Department analysts said USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes but some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987 grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes An analyst of Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be 25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213 mln tonne (grain) crop the analyst said In calculating Moscow's crop estimate USDA used the 235 mln tonne production goal as well as a 238 mln tonne figure published in a Soviet economic journal this month USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes a USDA source said Late season rains damaged Soviet crops slowed harvest progress and lowered Soviet production analysts said While in the US earlier this month Soviet agriculture official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln tonnes of grain were in the fields harvest problems would bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes Soviet Union outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday stressing the need to improve standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet industrial output should rise by 45 pct in 1988 up from a planned 44 pct in 1987 It rose 36 pct in Jan-Sept 1987 Talyzin said national income the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product should rise by 43 pct against a planned 41 pct this year Gross national product measures the output of a country's goods and services He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year Moscow produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986 Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires said Talyzin who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN Soviet data show the machine-building industry which makes machine tools instruments and other engineering goods increased output by 33 pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year However this was far below the 73 pct increase planned for the industry for the whole of 1988 Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better Large-scale measures are planned to save resources he said Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs the same figure as was announced last year Western governments view official Soviet estimates for defense spending as highly understated but say the real figure is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are intertwined with the civilian economy Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending next year on medical services education pensions and social insurance schemes official Soviet news agency Tass denounced a US Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would bring no dividends to the Reagan administration Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels The confrontation is a fact now What is obvious is that the latest military adventure will not bring political dividends to the American administration Krutikhin said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on Monday sparking diplomatic speculation that they were concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs Soviet officials have previously criticized the United States for sending naval forces into the Gulf saying their presence serves to increase tension Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and Iraq It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought broader contacts with Iran in the last year Krutikhin said: The United States has undertaken an act of armed aggression against Iran the probability of which has long been spoken of by Washington officials Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to rise by 45 pct in 1988 up from a planned 44 pct in 1987 In the first nine months of this year industrial output rose by 36 pct Talyzin said national income the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product is planned to rise by 43 pct against a planned 41 pct this year He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in 1988 compared with a planned 232 mln this year The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986 and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the harvest this year Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering industry which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires said Talyzin who heads the state planning committee Gosplan Soviet data show the machine-building industry which makes machine tools instruments and other engineering goods increased output by 33 pct in the first nine months of this year against the same period of 1986 This is well below the 73 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988 Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better Large-scale measures are planned to save resources he said Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet defence spending in 1988 would total 202 billion roubles the same as announced last year Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase spending next year on medical services education pensions and social insurance schemes He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171 billion roubles in 1988 or 35 billion roubles more than had originally been envisaged in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Plan sharp rise in Soviet sugar consumption since the start of the Kremlin's anti-alcohol drive indicates home brewing is costing the state 20 billion roubles in lost vodka sales Pravda said The Communist Party newspaper said sugar sales had increased by one mln tonnes a year enough to be turned into two billion bottles of moonshine At current vodka prices of 10 roubles a bottle it said this meant illicit alcohol consumption had reached the equivalent of 20 billion roubles a year or annual revenues from vodka sales before the May 1985 anti-alchohol decree Official statistics show a reduction in consumption of vodka but this is a deceptive statistic -- it does not count home-brew Pravda said The epidemic first engulfed the villages and has now also firmly settled into cities where the availability of natural gas running water and privacy has made it much easier Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev launched the anti-alcohol campaign shortly after taking office in March 1985 as a first step to improving Soviet economic performance which had been seriously hurt by drunkenness among the working population Soviet Union has agreed to supply Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100000 barrels per day of crude Iran's national news agency IRNA said IRNA monitored in Nicosia quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed during his visit The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet Union might double to 200000 bpd later he said Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet Union which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he left for Moscow Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined products Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr at Neka near the Caspian and at Jolfa in north-west Iran Soviet Union's industrial output is growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade has fallen Central Statistical Office figures show Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show industrial production rose 36 pct in the first nine months of 1987 against 52 pct in the same 1986 period Foreign trade in the same period fell 36 pct from the 1986 period as exports fell by 05 pct and imports dropped by 42 pct Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 942 billion roubles Separate import and export figures were not given One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction of a new quality control plan Western economists said Last year's calculations of industrial output included all goods irrespective of quality Under the new plan introduced in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy special inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below standard Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were rejected in the nine-month period The figures also showed that on October 1 there were more than 8000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80000 people More than 200000 were employed in the private sector Pravda said without giving comparative figures The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the economy has been an important part of the modernisation campaign with measures introduced recently to allow the setting up of small shops on a private basis Labour productivity rose 37 pct in the first nine months against 48 pct growth in January to September 1986 But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity figures with caution as they are more broadly based than in the West which measures worker output over a given period Pravda said there were 2838 mln people in the Soviet Union as of October 1 In the January to September 1987 period 1185 mln people were employed a rise of 44 pct on the same period last year Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against 194 roubles a year ago 
venezuela,A group of Latin American and Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in Congress saying it would curb their exports slow development and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt Mario Rodriguez Montero president of an Organization of American States special committee on trade said he was aware of the large US trade deficit but added the region should not be the one affected by the trade bills He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar and the budget deficit and it is regrettable to solve it by a trade bill that would only serve private US interests Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two days of meetings with US officials on trade bills now in Congress that are designed to reduce the US trade deficit which last year hit a record 1663 billion dlrs Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at Japan Taiwan South Korea and a few other nations with large annual trade surpluses with the United States Mexico Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations with large trade surpluses last year with the United States but even Mexico with the largest had a surplus of only 52 billion dlrs against Japan's of 586 billion dlrs The European Community has also opposed the bills Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in the legislation including those to curb imports and to require retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices He told reporters the committee would likely mount a campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate on the Senate floor expected next week Rodriguez said the region needs trade to continue development We hope this need will not be affected negatively by trade legislation Rodriguez said: we need to keep the market opens - especially the US market - to obtain the necessary foreign exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue national development progress President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he termed protectionist and his aides now are mounting a effort to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the legislation Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto Rodriguez said as yet the administration is not in a veto frame of mind will seek 24 billion dollars in export financing during 1987 double the amount it received last year public finance director jorge marcano said Marcano told reporters at the finance ministry yesterday that the 24 billion is part of a total package of 32 billion dlrs in new credits which venezuela will try to obtain we've begun efforts to secure that financing he said may turn to the international monetary fund for credits as part of the country's overall effort to reestablish financial flows from abroad finance minister manuel azpurua said today this is no secret It's just one of the steps the executive has begun taking to reestablish financial flows to the country azpurua told reporters at the finance ministry He did not specify what types of loans venezuela would seek from the fund or the amounts involved A technical team from the imf is currently in caracas gathering data for its annual report on the venezuelan economy the finance minstry said Members of the mission met today with officials from the ministry's public finance department Venezuela is one of the few latin american debtors which has not drawn standby or extended fund facilty loans from the imf since the region's financial crisis began in 1982 The country has an imf quota of 1371 mln sdr's (175 billion dollars) according to the fund's 1986 report authorities and police are investigating an alleged fraud by the second largest trading house in the Caracas free foreign exchange market Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua told reporters The Superintendency of Banks and the Technical and Judicial Police have both begun probes of Cambio la Guiara Azpurua said on Friday night Police said the owners of the firm Mario Muggia and his brother Luigi Muggia have left Venezuela Cambio la Guiara operated in part on the parallel market in which traders buy and sell dollars among themselves The Venezuelan central bank on June 17 suspended the licences of all 21 foreign exchange operators in the parallel market blaming their speculation for the constant rise in the value of the US Dollar here Juan Domingo Cordero vice-president of the Caracas Stock Exchange and the owner of a foreign exchange trading house said on Friday he had begun legal action against Cambio la Guiara for issuing him four checks without funds for a total amount of almost one mln dlrs The Cambio la Guiara exchange house had operated in Venezuela for more than 20 years Group Inc's MW Kellogg Co subsidiary said it in consortium with <Inelectra> received a contract from Corpoven SA a Venezuelan-owned domestic oil company to revamp and expand its El Palito Refinery Kellogg said the installed cost of the work to be performed is estimated to be 130 mln dlrs Inelectra Kellogg said is a major Venezuelan engineering firm Kellog said the project will enable the refinery to produce BTX products -- benzene toluene and orthoxylene -- by processing naphtha feed from an expanded reformer-hydrotreater Kellogg said the refinery's reformer-hydrotreater will be upgraded to 9500 barrels a day capacity from 7500 It said the new BTX process units include aromatic extraction xylene fractionation xylene isomerization and thermal hydrodealkylation Kellogg pointed out that Venezuela now imports all of its BTX aromatics government tomorrow presents a 1988 budget proposal for 183432 billion bolivars based upon an oil price of 1635 dlrs per barrel finance minister Manuel Azpurua said Azpurua told reporters after a cabinet meeting the new budget projects ordinary income of 149925 billion bolivars and extraordinary income of 34186 billion Oil revenues are expected to produce 92014 billion or 61 pct of the total The finance minister said the oil revenue projection is based on an average price of 1635 dlrs per barrel in 1988 Venezuelan oil through the first half of 1987 has averaged 16 20 dlrs per barrel according to the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA oil prices would remain stable despite the US Attack against Iranian oil platforms and growing tension in the Gulf Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday He described the situation as extremely tense but said Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices because supply and demand were roughly equal Demand for OPEC crude in the final quarter of 1987 was 185 mln barrels per day (bpd) and the group's members were now pumping above 18 mln bpd he told a news conference Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction continued Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries were overproducing in an exaggerated manner above their assigned quotas he said OPEC's overall ceiling is 166 mln bpd will back Ecuador's bid to raise its OPEC quota above 221000 barrels per day (bpd) because it is a justifiable demand Venezuelan Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an earthquake last March For this five-month period Ecuador did not exercise its right to produce 221000 bpd he said We should recognize Ecuador's right to increase its quota  There is a basis of justice in that country's petition He added however the quota increase should be gradual to avoid harming the market he added Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna Energy Minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said he foresaw market stability in the price of crude despite growing tension in the Gulf augmented by the US military attack on an Iranian oil platform He told a news conference the market continues to be stable despite all the military action in the Gulf Central Bank President Hernan Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry two leading Venezuelan newspapers reported The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would leave his position soon Lusinchi already has decided on his successor the El Nacional reported Central Bank officials were not available for comment Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance Ministry over economic policy particularly over the direction of interest rates He favoured raising the rates which are currently well below the annual inflation rate of 332 pct But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance Ministry and government officials who thought an interest increase would fuel inflation

price package yesterday an EC Commission spokesman said However he said he could not rule out such a meeting altogether noting the decision is one for Belgium which currently holds the presidency of the EC council of ministers The farm ministers could also meet in parallel with the meeting of EC heads of government in Brussels on June 29 and 30 diplomats noted The ministers ended their three-day meeting in Luxembourg still split on the question of an oils and fats tax and with West Germany saying it would use its veto on two other key aspects of EC Commission proposals the actual common price changes and a revision of the green money system The Commission spokesman said an announcement is likely to appear in the EC's Official Journal within a few days giving notice of the Commission's intention to take emergency measures from July 1 should ministers fail to reach an accord However Commission sources said this notice would not detail the measures to be taken which they said might be considered by the Commission at its regular weekly meeting next Wednesday The Commission published a declaration by EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen made in Luxembourg early yesterday at the end of the agriculture ministers' meeting In it Andriessen said there was now a serious threat to the functioning of the Common Agricultural Policy Andriessen added The CommissionWill take the measures which are necessary not only for the temporary management of the markets but also for a healthy finance policy This means that the protective measures we are going to apply will necessarily have in

marks from 1990 Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Kohl told a news conference The tax reform will be realised as agreed by the coalition after the (last general) election in January He said the leadership of his own Christian Democratic party repeated its support for the tax reform timetable at a meeting this week CDU vice-chairman Lothar Spaeth also reiterated his doubts about whether the reform was feasible as planned but received no support from other party members he added Kohl said the government intends to decide by the autumn how to raise around 19 billion marks still needed to finance the tax reform Subsidies paid to ailing industries are the main target for trimming to pay for the tax reform But politicians both inside and outside the government have expressed doubts about making politically painful cuts in subsidies water levels on the Rhine caused by heavy rain are delaying an operation near Karlsruhe to raise two sunken boats which have blocked the river's main navigation channel since early last week a Karlsruhe water authority spokesman said He said two floating cranes were unable to begin lifting the sunken tug Orinoko and its lighter because the water level had reached 815 centimetres and was forecast to rise to 820-830 cm by tomorrow He was unable to say when the operation might begin Meanwhile high water at Cologne has forced vessels to travel at reduced speed a water authority spokesman in Cologne said But a water authority spokesman in Duisburg 60 kms north of Cologne said vessels there were moving normally salvage firm Smit-Tak said it may take some three weeks to lift the Swiss tug Orinoko and its lighter Pavo which sank 10 days ago at Karlsruhe in West Germany blocking the Rhine river Smit-Tak which with its West German subsidiary Harms Bergung GmbH was commissioned by the local water authorities to raise the vessels said its lifting fleet was in position and divers had made the first inspection Smit is still preparing its final salvage plan and said the work would begin on Sunday and wet weather in northern western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet growth but plant density is reported to be good in most countries sugar statistician FO Licht said Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged fields But in eastern and southeastern Europe warmer weather has boosted sugar beet growth Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet development Licht said In Sweden beet growth has been delayed although plant population is reported to be regular and good Cool and rainy weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are rated as slightly below normal In the United Kingdom and Ireland it was rather cool with heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth In France Belgium the Netherlands and West Germany it was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work impossible In Austria it was warm with some rainfall which was favourable for beet growth Licht said In Czechoslovakia and Poland it was mostly warm favouring beet development but some heavy rain may have caused damage In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was generally good for the emergence and growth of beets In south eastern Europe warm weather with some rainfall boosted beet development Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain Disputes between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to delay the start of processing in the southern areas where beets are maturing very early this year Medical Inc said it will close three facilities and take a fourth quarter charge of 625000 dlrs or 15 cents per share which will result in a fourth quarter loss The company said net earnings for the year will be below the 18 mln dlrs earned last year It also noted earnings for the year will be affected by a 13 cent per share operating loss from its Sunrise Medical GmbH unit in West Germany It said the closures to be completed by the end of 1987 year are part of a cost reduction and plant consolidation program The company said plants to closed are the Trans-Aid factory in Turbotville Penn the Minivator factory in Dunstable England and the Sunrise Medical GmbH

issued in March Extraordinary earnings linked to sale of subsidiaries fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG's <BKFGF> (BfG) partial operating profits in the first four months of this year were lower than in the same period in 1986 management board chairman Thomas Wegscheider said But the balance sheet total at the end of May was four pct higher than one year earlier as savings continued to flow into the bank he told the annual press conference BfG parent bank partial operating profits halved to 166 mln marks in 1986 from 311 mln in 1985 with the balance sheet falling to 4880 billion marks from 4902 billion Wegscheider declined to give a forecast for the full year and noted that the first four months of this year were not comparable with the 1986 period as first quarter 1986 had been extremely successful for the bank The general banking environment this year was not easy with the interest margin under pressure securities business suffering from markedly lower bourse turnover than last year and sluggish credit demand he said As far as the specific BfG environment is concerned we note a clear atmospheric improvement which however is being reflected in the figures only slowly he added Wegscheider said the bank was recovering from speculation about its ownership which had unnerved many customers last year and from the financial crisis involving the Neue Heimat housing group linked to BfG's former trade union owners Insurer Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVGF> AMB acquired 50 pct plus one share of BfG late last year Wegscheider said that earnings from trading on the bank's own account in 1986 had been a little higher than partial operating profits but had performed better in the first half Following the AMB acquisition BfG sold its 2501 pct stake in <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG> its 749 pct in <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG> These sales produced extraordinary earnings of 700 mln marks with parent bank earnings from profit transfer agreements rising to 49418 mln marks in 1986 from 5424 mln in 1985 and other earnings including writing bank risk provisions rising to 31795 mln marks from 6567 mln Wegscheider said most of the extraordinary earnings went into risk provisions Total risk provisions undetailed were more than twice as high as in 1985 Wegscheider said Published group risk provisions rose to 8659 mln marks from 3667 mln But the share of credits to problem countries covered by risk provisions was still below 50 pct at BfG he said The BSV Bank stake sale was one of the main factors behind a 38 billion mark drop in the group balance sheet in 1986 Wegscheider said the re-organization of BfG planned before the AMB acquisition and involving a decentralization would occupy much of BfG's energies this year BfG and AMB were also looking at ways of cooperating in sales of services analysts and commentators say Volkswagen AG <VOWGF> has suffered an enormous loss of face from which it could take time to recover over its 473 mln mark currency swindle An auditors' report on the affair prepared in time for this week's annual shareholders' meeting largely cleared the management of Volkswagen of blame But mud sticks said Gavin Launder an analyst with Scrimgeour Vickers in London (See index on ECRA) The financial daily Boersenzeitung wrote in a commentary: More devastating than the losses linked to the currency scandal is the resulting loss of image for the company VW had to make provisions of 473 mln marks to cover losses from unauthorised foreign exchange deals which the auditors Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft said highlighted major gaps in the supervisory apparatus of the firm's financial department The auditors' report highlighted failings in VW's controlling system especially in relation to a 385 mln mark deal with the Hungarian National Bank but shed little light on why they were made It said the contracts did not benefit VW and were only advantageous to its banks It did not detail how the foreign exchange dealers may have profitted It concluded: The nature scope and technical construction of the deals  Suggest a targeted and professionally executed manipulation to the detriment of VW The head of the finance department Rolf Selowsky resigned days after the scandal broke in March He is not accused of any wrongdoing but auditors concluded he had not applied the necessary diligence in all instances Two former VW foreign exchange dealers have been arrested But even VW admits that the report published last week revealed important company failings Peter Frerk who has temporarily taken over Selowsky's reponsibilities said the findings were not a first class acquittal The currency swindle was a lamentable event for our company he told journalists The auditors said the remaining members of VW's management board and supervisory board had correctly fulfilled their obligations a verdict which almost certainly means that major West German banks who vote on behalf of large numbers of shareholders will ratify both boards at the July 2 meeting Many market analysts especially in London do not believe a sharp rise in VW's share price last week reflects a major reassessment of the firm on the basis of the auditors' report The stock closed at 430 marks on Friday up 11 pct from a week earlier Dealers referrred to short-term bargain-hunting and one London broker said I'm not sure it's much of a bargain Most brokers said they would not recommend clients to buy at these levels Analysts believe VW will do well to match its 1986 group net profit of 582 mln marks this year and one broker in London said the company would be lucky to report profits only 15 pct down VW is expected to fare very well both in its home market and in Europe But sales have fallen sharply in the US and Brazil where the latest price freeze could exacerbate results even further The company hopes to benefit in the long term from its takeover of the Spanish company SEAT but this subsidiary is still producing losses VW has also just announced a deal to build light pick-up trucks with Toyota Motor Corp <TOYOT> at an under-utilised plant in Hanover but analysts noted production here was only expected to take off fully in 1990 AG <DGSGF> said it planned a one-for-five rights issue at 225 marks per share raising nominal share capital by 61 mln marks by the end of its current business year ending September 30 The company said in a statement it would also raise nominal share capital by 20 mln marks in a share swap as part of its planned takeover of French medicine group <Laboratoires Sarget SA> The two capital measures will raise Degussa nominal share capital to 365 mln marks Degussa said last week it intended to buy 100 pct of the capital of the medical pharmaceuticals group Sarget based in Merignac near Bordeaux Sarget had 1986 sales in France Belgium the Netherlands Spain Portugal and Italy of 730 mln French francs Degussa has not said how much it would pay for Sarget but 20 mln marks nominal of 50-mark shares at today's Frankfurt opening price of 49470 marks would be worth nearly 198 mln marks A 61 mln mark nominal capital increase at 225 marks would raise 2745 mln marks Degussa said the 20 mln mark nominal capital increase would take the form of an issue of shares for a non-cash consideration The April 10 annual meeting agreed that there would be no rights issue on this capital which was already authorized but unissued The rights issue involving the 61 mln mark nominal capital increase will be led by Dresdner Bank AG Following that capital increase Degussa would be left with 19 mln marks of authorized but unissued capital a Degussa spokesman said Part of the 2745 mln marks from the rights issue would also be used for the Serget acquisition he added President Karl Otto Poehl said West Germany would be badly advised to lower interest rates and that he believed the economy would continue to recover after a six-month lull Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest rates could boost the domestic economy Poehl said: We would be badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts This could under certain circumstances release new inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to higher interest rates he added Poehl said Germany had practically no growth in the past six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter But since April statistics clearly show that the economy finds itself on a course of growth he said I expect this development to continue in the coming months Asked about his expectations of a US-European Community trade war Poehl said such an event would be disastrous For this reason we in Europe must avoid everything used by protectionist forces in the US As pretexts he added This includesEliminating existing restrictions in the EC as far as possible Protectionism is not found only in the US KGaA <HNKGF> expects 1987 world group turnover and profit to exceed 1986 levels as recent acquisitions should compensate for the negative impact of the strong mark managing board chairman Helmut Sihler said He told the annual meeting that based on Henkel's performance so far the profit increase would be not insignificant World group sales rose six pct in the first five months this year compared with the same 1986 period but group turnover rose only two pct because of currency factors he said Sihler said the profit increase surpassed that of turnover but gave no figure As reported group net profit rose 28 pct to 226 mln marks in 1986 World group sales by volume rose six pct but currency factors trimmed group turnover by six pct to 87 billion marks Sihler said the 1986 profit/sales ratio of 26 pct should rise further this year Sihler said turnover grew more or less equally in all sectors As reported the 1986 dividend on ordinary voting shares rose to 450 marks from 350 in 1985 while the dividend on non-voting preference shares increased to 750 marks compared with three marks for six months of 1985 European Investment Bank is raising 200 mln marks through an eight-year bullet eurobond carrying a 6-1/8 pct coupon and priced at 99-1/2 pct to yield 621 pct at issue lead manager Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale said Payment date is July 16 the bond pays interest on that date annually and matures on that date in 1995 Fees total 1-3/4 pct with 5/8 for underwriting and management and 1-1/8 for selling Denominations are 1000 and 10000 marks and the bond will be listed in Duesseldorf and Frankfurt specially convened Franco-German meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has deeply split the two former EC allies diplomats said The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign ministers from both countries and by French President Francois Mitterand his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the Community's worst-ever budget crisis The Germans clearly do not want to budge an aide to Chirac told reporters He added the French Prime Minister was visibly angered as he the hour-long meeting Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the EC's complex green currrency system designed to translate common EC farm prices into national currencies Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which West Germany is against along with Britain Denmark and the Netherlands EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the package which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline tomorrow Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have injected fresh impetus into those talks The Commission proposed its package to save one billion dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group and plugging a 57 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987 Inc and Continental AG of Hanover West Germany jointy announced they signed an agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash Under the agreement the companies said Continental will acquire General Tire including its related domestic and foreign operations and Gencorp will retain liability for the medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired on or before November 30 1984 The sale is expected to be completed on or before November one and is subject to meeting certain conditions Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer Last year the company had sales of 26 billion dlrs with 19 billion dlrs generated by its tire operations Last year General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln dlrs on sales of 11 billion dlrs and Gencorp had operating profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 31 billion dlrs GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire employees under the agreement Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to reduce its 15 billion dlr debt In April GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase of up to 54 pct or 125 mln shares of its common at 130 dlrs a share for a total of 16 billion dlrs As part of the restructuring GenCorp also said it planned to sell its tire business the bottling operations of its RKO General Inc subsidiary and RKO's remaining broadcast properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive components businesses Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company including general tire The price paid for General tire would not cause us to reevaluate that estimate said Tilden General Tire employs 10000 people worldwide and has four tire manufacturing plants in the US and one in Canada In a statemnet A William Reynolds GenCorp chairman said the sale of General Tire represents a critical accomplishment in our plan to restructure GenCorp Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of its other businesses are proceeding satisfactorily Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold are its RKO bottling operations GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co <DIS> for 217 mln dlrs That deal awaits approval by the Federal Communications Commission GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV cocoa producers are expanding output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market from our product said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate general of plantations We're happy about our long-term future Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable for European tastes They were responding to comments by London traders that large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa prices London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a high level of free fatty acids Ng Siew Kee the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers' Council said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western Europe A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans When the market is declining buyers seize on anything to talk down prices the spokesman said He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces PNG exported 33000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa year ending September 30 of which nearly 50 pct was exported to West Germany 16 pct to the US And the rest to the Netherlands and Britain The Indonesia spokesman an Agriculture Ministry official who wished not to be identified said Indonesia had no problem with quality and would continue to expand sales He described criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as trade politics and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it did not have any difficulty with exports Indonesia and Malaysia Asia's two biggest commodity producers are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to total 150000 to 155000 tonnes in calendar 1987 This is up from 131000 tonnes in 1986 partly because of the end of a three-year drought in Sabah the country's largest cocoa growing area Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31600 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10284 tonnes in 1980 Output is projected to rise to 50000 tonnes in 1988 from 38000 tonnes this year as young trees mature Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and traders said they could last out low prices longer than West African countries According to one Kuala Lumpur trader world prices would have to fall another 1000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic Some traders believe the main quality problem is with harvesting and fermentation techniques One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian estates of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he welcomed Monday's US And West German joint confirmation of their commitment to the Louvre accord Sumita said in a statement that world stockmarkets were excessively concerned about the economic future The Bank of Japan will continue to adhere to a system of policy coordination based upon the Louvre accord of February he said The accord called for stability in foreign exchange rates Exchange rates generally are regaining stability and the economies of industrialised nations are heading for a steady recovery he said German car and van production rose in September to 407600 from 386000 in September 1986 while exports climbed to 226300 from 218200 the German Automobile Industry Association VDA said The association added that incoming domestic orders in September were above and foreign orders roughly equal to those in September last year Car and van production rose in the first nine months of the year to 325 mln from 319 mln But exports fell to 180 mln from 185 mln Output of light trucks fell in September to 13200 from 14700 while heavy truck production was unchanged at 10100 Over the nine month period light truck production fell to 109300 from 129200 while heavy truck production dipped to 83800 from 84700 Exports of light trucks fell in September to 7800 from 9000 and to 66600 from 84300 in the first nine months Exports of heavy trucks rose to 5500 in September from 4600 in September last year and to 47800 from 45300 in the first nine months in West German and international interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern Poehl told an investment conference I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest in higher capital market rates he said Shortly after Poehl spoke the Bundesbank announced a tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 380 pct Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 385 pct at last week's pact from 360 on the last fixed-rate tender in late September The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to 380 from 385 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections of money market liquidity at between 370 and 380 pct These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting between Poehl Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and US Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability Over the weekend criticism by Baker of the tightening in West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in nervous trading to trade above 179 marks Tuesday Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not due to central bank policy but to markets' expectations and currency developments Commenting on the inflationary expectations Poehl said You have to get to the root of the problem you have to pursue a policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated he said Poehl rebuffed recent US Criticism of West Germany saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to international cooperation in interest and monetary policy The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money supply target arousing criticism from other quarters he said Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of 1986 Quite the contrary of other countries where interest rates have risen substantially more Poehl said This had to be taken into account when considering recent rises in repurchase pact allocation rates which were due to rising international money market rates that had spilled over into the German market he said Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far ignored improvements in the US Deficits The adjustment process in the US Trade balance is definitely underway he said noting that this was not so noticeable in absolute figures The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also attracted little attention he said German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the global share price crash was overdone and unfounded Stoltenberg was speaking at a press conference German Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the meeting on Monday with US Treasury Secretary James Baker underscored the determination of the US And West Germany to continue close cooperation to stabilise foreign exchange rates Stoltenberg told a news conference The statement released yesterday (Monday) after the private meeting  Emphasized our determination to continue the close economic cooperation regarding foreign exchange stabilization and monetary policy Stoltenberg said that he Baker and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl had a very constructive discussion and had all reached a positive evaluation of the Louvre accord during their meeting on Monday Stoltenberg said initial contacts with several European counterparts showed that they shared this view We expect the declaration of our unified position to have a positive effect he said He noted that the dollar firmed again in late US Trading after the outcome of the Baker meeting was published German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the Louvre accord was vital to West Germany Stoltenberg told a news conference Given West Germany's unusually high dependence on world trade and exports it is vital for West Germany  To continue its constructive contribution to trusting (international) cooperation on the basis of the Louvre accord Some monetary analysts have speculated that inflation-conscious Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger may have been leading the central bank to a course of tighter monetary policy Stoltenberg is due to attend a routine Bundesbank meeting on Thursday in West Berlin He declined to forecast what if any policy decisions the Bundesbank might take German new car registrations rose four pct last month compared with September 1986 and were 28 pct higher than August's figure the Federal Motor Office said September new car registrations totalled 234518 up from 225581 in the same month a year ago and from 183224 in August In the first nine months of this year new car registrations rose 29 pct to 218 mln from 212 mln during January/September 1986 Total vehicle registrations in the period rose to 242 mln from 235 mln in January/September last year German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg declined to comment on whether unpublished target zones for currencies agreed at last February's Louvre accord had been changed as a result of the meeting on Monday with US Treasury Secretary James Baker He was asked about target zones at a news conference in Bonn Stoltenberg referred to a statement released after Monday's meeting which said continuing cooperation was aimed at promoting currency stability at current levels This was the same formula used in the text of the Louvre accord he noted German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he could not rule out the possibility of central bank intervention to support currencies Asked at a news conference whether central banks were prepared to intervene to defend currencies he said We cannot rule out the use of any instrument which leads to foreign currency stability However he added that in the end it was market forces which prevailed German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said that there were absolutely no signs of current dangers to price stability in West Germany He was speaking at a news conference shortly after Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt that inflationary fears which have been responsible for recent interest rate increases were unjustified and exaggerated demand remained strong in the United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen in the same months last year with most of the rise coming in soymeal the Hamburg based publication Oil World said Total US domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987 up 42 pct on the same year-ago period with the increase in soymeal at seven pct it said Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310000 tonnes in July and 330000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months following a huge increase in soymeal imports Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately but went into stocks With imports again large in September it estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800000 tonnes by October 1 from around 130000 at the same time last year EC oilmeal demand rose 100000 tonnes in August from a year earlier with soymeal up 45000 tonnes Crushings of rapeseed sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to bumper EC crops It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record 59 mln tonnes up from 37 mln last year Rapeseed disposals were reported at 21 mln tonnes by September 20 against 14 mln at that time last year And West German reaffirmation of support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the current collapse in stock markets London economists said There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the dollar is going to be allowed to slip said Richard Jeffrey of Hoare Govett If not there is going to be continued fear that when pressure emerges on the dollar the Fed will be forced to tighten This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the US With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world But some economists added that Wall Street's crash which dragged other major markets down with it may help curb the very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation fears and the massive and persistent US Trade deficits If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide said Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel echoing comments from other London and Tokyo analysts Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of further falls should dampen credit growth curbing inflationary pressures and import demand in the US They say Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the equity crash according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson It would be suicidal for any government in the context of what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their interest rates he added Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime lending rate half a point to 925 pct Tuesday and US Fed chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial system The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock collapse would spill over into the economy via a banking crisis for example thus precipitating recession It also helped the dollar rally sharply to a high of 18200 marks from a European low of 17880 But economists said today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in mind The United States has been able to live on borrowed time If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic growth not recessionIt contains good news (and) provides a more realistic assessment of the US Economy said Capel's Dennis But he added that markets are still very much in danger The liquidity doesn't disappearAll it's doing is disappearing from the equity markets Dennis noted David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies is still on Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency stability But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad said Morrison The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived To stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong he said Finance Minister Michael Wilson says the leading industrial nations have held a number of discussions on providing liquidity to the financial system after Monday's record stock market decline There have been a number of discussions between G-7 participants (Canada the United States Japan Britain West Germany France and Italy) he told reporters after emerging from a cabinet meeting There is an intent to make sure there is sufficient liquidity in the system Clearly this is one of the reasons why the bond markets have been firmer interest rates have been dropping Wilson said The level of interest rates had been one of the factors that had concerned the equity markets I have been in touch with my G-7 colleagues in a number of countries Wilson said This has been going on during the course of yesterday through the evening and this morning and this will continue he said What we have all agreed on is (that) the basic strengths of our economieslooks good Wilson said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur has been in contact with several Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in particular West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg to discuss the crisis on world markets Finance Ministry sources said They did not say whether the contacts had led to concerted action on the markets or merely an exchange of views But they added that French ministry officials were continuing the contacts to exchange views on market performance president Karl Otto Poehl said there were good chances for exchange rate stability The chances for exchange rate stability are good he told reporters international share crash was exaggerated and did not reflect economic fundamentals Wolfgang Roeller president of the West German banking association BDB said in a statement A comparison with the (Wall Street crash of) 1929 is totally inappropriate Roeller also chief executive of Dresdner Bank AG said The world economy was growing and dangers of inflation were being held in check The recent International Monetary Fund and World meetings confirmed the positive forecasts for global economic development Therefore there were no rational reasons for a sharp tightening of monetary policy nor for a continued rise in interest rates Roeller said This applies in particular to West Germany he said As a result Roeller expected the markets to calm They would not ignore long-term economic factors International cooperation on currencies established by the Louvre accord and strengthened by Monday's meeting between US Treasury Secretary James Baker West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl would stand the test he added Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the recent dispute between the United States and West Germany over economic policy was responsible for much financial turmoil and that it should never have happened He said in a television interview the dispute had fanned fears of a breakdown in the cooperation which is so important between finance ministers of the major nations He said the dispute was a row which should not have happened and agreed that much of the blame lay with US Treasury Secretary James Baker who had publicly criticised West Germany for having raised its key interest rates United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates European economists said But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and US Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt according to official statements released late Monday Only 13 hours after the statements were released the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 380 pct down from a 385 pct facility rate offered last week While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday It's round one to the Americans  said Richard Reid senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London But Reid added We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 005 percentage point Over the weekend criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday the dollar was quoted at 17918 marks compared with 17740 on Monday Guenther Aschoff chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes then all the better he said No central bank wants to let interest rates rise and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the US Aschoff said Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern Giles Keating economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battleBut he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington Before the IMF meeting when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 360 pct Keating noted Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability In addition both the US And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC officials said Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat fish and cereals by-products But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the officials said The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the officials said Under the deal Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4500 tonnes to 34300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3000 tonnes to 53000 tonnes Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough We hope that there will be an improvement he said Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic policies voiced by US Treasury Secretary James Baker but added that the criticism was not purely one-sided Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United States) He added Criticism is not a one-way street He did not elaborate but Bonn has often called on the US To reduce its federal budget deficit Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic policies saying that rises in domestic interest rates here were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to stabilise currencies Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with Baker had resolved differences between the two countries At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms but he had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday one remark or another has been clarified engineering group AEG AG <AEGGF> in which Daimler-Benz AG <DAIGF> has a majority is reorganizing its energy business AEG said in a statement AEG will invest 250 mln marks over the next three years in a new turbines electrical machinery and power station plant division which will include its <AEG Kanis GmbH> subsidiary The investment includes a new turbine factory for AEG Kanis in Essen and the restructuring of AEG's Nuremberg works into a specialized components and rotor factory The project is part of the Daimler group's energy technology strategy AEG said official Washington sought to restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street collapse Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values Nigel Lawson British Chancellor of the Exchequer was among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great That I think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic It was a dispute that should never have happened he added Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis Said one US analyst of Baker's weekend remarks His timing could not have been worse One government bond salesman in New York said He actually thought that yelling at the Germans and threatening to smack the dollar down would work That doesn't show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship However some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand On the surface Baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets) it was West German policy said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York All Mr Baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger he said After Monday's talks the US and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord pieced together in Paris in February was still in effect Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values Treasury sources said that Baker already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite He felt that the US recovery inching along in its 59th month could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion A growing US economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports Moreover Baker the consummate politician was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off US economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 32 pct annual rate There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly or else obviously the panic will feed on itself and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview In many ways the official response was mild Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was puzzled US government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and presumably their political impact For all of this it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony Oh I think it's much too late to be doing thatYou have an administration that's taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap You just can't do that Reagan said the United States remains committed to the Louvre accord in which the seven major industrial nations agreed to stabilize currency exchange rates The United States remains committed to the Louvre agreement Reagan said in a statement following a meeting with his top economic advisers Reagan said the United States Japan and West Germany had all reaffirmed their commitment to coordinate economic policies Reagan said Japanese Prime Minister-designate Noboru Takeshita said in a telephone conversation Tuesday morning that his (Takeshita's) top priority was to maintain stable economic relations with the United States Reagan noted that Treasury Secretary James Baker met with West German financial officials and reaffirmed their commitment to the Louvre agreement They reaffirmed our agreement to coordinate economic policies to provide for non-inflationary growth and stable exchange rates Reagan said Manhattan Corp (CMB) president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic conditions If we are right about the fundamentals this thing should settle down Labrecque said at a news conference at the American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause US monetary officials to ease credit policies Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year Labrecque said He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to continue well into 1988 I don't think the stock market will cause a recession Labrecque said He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from the stock market fall would be Chase's stock price however dropped 23 pct but other money center banks suffered even sharper losses Referring to the banking industry he said: We're talking about one day These are strong institutions he said Labrecque said he did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary policy in view of the stock market's behavior If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the other way he said Labrecque said the high US budget deficit was not the single most important factor behind the market's worries He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the United States West Germany Japan and Britain agriculture ministers attacked plans to penalise farmers immediately it becomes clear that cereals output is above standard norms EC sources said They said this was the major criticism raised at a meeting of ministers which discussed Commission proposals for curbing spending on the cereals regime The Commission wants powers to cut guaranteed prices or raise the coresponsibility levy if output next harvest rises above 155 mln tonnes The sources said several ministers complained that changing price levels in the middle of a season would severely damage the financial security of farmers But an EC Commission spokesman said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen told them producers could not be guaranteed security regardless of market circumstances The sources said there was a general acceptance of the need for some output ceilings However the French and Dutch ministers called for a maximum output for a wider range of cereal crops rather than for cereals alone The sources added West Germany wanted production ceilings for individual countries with excess production being paid for from national exchequers but received no support for this idea British farm minister John MacGregor told reporters he detected more support for his position against the penalties on farmers being administered through higher coresponsibility levies He said he believes increasing the levies would do nothing to increase EC cereals consumption whereas lower prices for farmers could help in this direction of a meeting between US Treasury Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets allowing the dollar to recoup much of the day's losses dealers said News of the meeting which took place in Frankfurt in great secrecy came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by Baker of West German monetary policy which had provoked fears that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy The dollar reacted immediately to the news rising over two pfennigs in after hours New York trading dealers there said The announcement of the meeting also attended by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl was made simultaneously in Bonn and Washington timed for after the closure of New York markets Baker Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the February Louvre accord a finance ministry spokesman in Bonn said The dollar rose to 17970/90 marks from New York's close of 17730/40 It had closed there on Friday at 17975/85 marks The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest rates and stock markets crashed worldwide Baker had said that West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord Under the accord leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability with the surplus countries West Germany and Japan stimulating their economies and the US promising to cut its budget deficit West German government sources said rising West German money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre pact They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the United States US Bond yields have been rising since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed raised the discount rate to 600 pct from 550 German yields have also risen over this period but less markedly and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up short-term rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts its principal instrument for steering the money market The allocation rate on the last facility was 385 pct compared with 360 pct This was partly due to West Germany's inability to uncouple itself from US interest rate trends but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth which raised fears of domestically produced inflation bank economists said This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally to the more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger In an apparent gesture to Baker coinciding with his visit the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease US anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much under American fire said Chris Zwermann currency adviser at Swiss Bank Corp here It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a significant retreat from its position added Giles Keating economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact on Tuesday and its result on Wednesday money market economists said Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation rate which is likely to turn out at between 380 and 390 pct little changed from the 385 pct on the last facility The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place although the Finance Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman asked to comment on the apparent US-German clash over the Louvre accord went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West Germany for Sweden on Monday This week he is also due to visit Denmark and Belgium Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson welcomed on Monday the reaffirmation by the US And West Germany of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilising currencies His office said Lawson had welcomed the outcome of a meeting between US Treasury Secretary James Baker Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg in Frankfurt After the meeting a Bonn finance ministry spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing key interest rates saying they were not in line with last February's Louvre accord Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl in Frankfurt on Monday a Bonn Finance Ministry spokesman said After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be stabilised at around current levels The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for increasing short-term money market interest rates He had said the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord aimed at stabilizing the US dollar last February The meeting had been arranged last week the spokesman said Baker Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to currency stability and monetary policy Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into the West German money market in a move which money market dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary authority to curb interest rate rises The spokesman described Monday's talks which he called private as very positive Community Commission President Jacques Delors called for a swift convening of a meeting of the G-7 countries following the instability in today's trading on world money and stock markets He told a press conference here: G-7 should meet discreetly and quickly Delors said if the dollar were to fall further against the mark to levels around 160 the European Monetary System would undergo a test by fire Delors said the current problems in the markets had been caused by excessive growth in financial trading excessive deregulation and the failure of the fundamentals of the world economy to adapt themselves quickly enough to changing circumstances He said it was profoundly unjust to blame it on recent increases in West Germany Treasury Secretary James Baker met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl today in West Germany and agreed to support the Louvre pact the Treasury Department said The Treasury described the meeting as a very positive private meeting in Frankfurt West Germany which had been agreed upon last week The parties agreed to continue economic cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible application including cooperation on exchange rate stability and monetary policies the Treasury said The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg are consulting with their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven leading industrial countries including the United States and West Germany to promote currency stability Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this week and the department earlier refused to release details of his travel itinerary citing security considerations European Community is willing to offer limited concessions to the United States on one of two major issues which threaten to poison their trade relations next year an EC commission spokesman said He said the offer would be made at a meeting later this month between US Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter and EC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen told agriculture ministers meeting in Luxembourg that the EC is willing to make some temporary arrangements to lighten the impact on US Exports of an EC plan to ban the sales of meat from animals fed with growth hormones the spokesman said Washington has said it will take trade reprisals if the EC proceeds with the ban from January 1 and if European countries do not quickly cut back what it sees as unfair subsidies to the makers of their Airbus airliner which are harming US Manufacturers It claims the hormones ban has no scientific basis and will rob it of 130 mln dlrs' worth of exports a year Diplomatic sources said the Yeutter-de Clercq meeting will take place in London and will also involve the aerospace ministers of France Britain West Germany and Spain the countries involved in the Airbus project ministers from major industrial nations should hold a special meeting to deal with the US Dollar's sharp decline Helmut Geiger president of the West German savings bank association said Geiger told Finance ministers should meet soon to take confidence-building measures to limit the damage caused by the dollar's fall Separately Geiger told Bild newspaper in an interview released ahead of publication on Tuesday that the lower dollar which had been artificially talked down by US officials would damage West German exports and cost jobs African Development Bank plans to raise about 200 mln dlrs via a US Domestic bond this year Milan Kerno vice president of finance said at a presentation He said the Bank planned to borrow about 700 mln dlrs in world capital markets in 1987 and roughly the same amount in 1988 Because of the weak condition of the euroyen market plans for a bond in that sector which would comprise part of the 700 mln dlrs have been put on hold Kerno said But we should complete our programme (this year) markets willing Kerno said adding the Bank's 1987 borrowing so far totaled about 400 mln dlrs The Bank's board of directors will meet on October 26 to discuss plans to begin Bank trading in unspecified securities with desks in Abidjan Kerno said Trading would be conducted along similar lines as existing World Bank and Asian Development Bank operations he said The Bank now has roughly 12 billion dlrs in available liquidity to serve as a basis for trading although not all of this will be traded at the start The Bank plans to use the funds gradually over the next three or four years he said To facilitate lending increases the Bank tripled paid-in capital to about 18 billion dlrs from six billion in June German bankers at the presentation criticized the Bank for its overly conservative lending adding the Bank would do better to invest more capital in loans Total net equity capital consisting of subscribed capital and reserves rose to 1282 pct of its funded debt in 1986 from 552 pct in 1985 the Bank's statistics showed Other Bank figures from 1986 showed the Interamerican Development Bank's net equity totaled 302 pct of funded debt and the Asian Development Bank's 295 pct Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said the Louvre Accord is still healthy but said the United States and West Germany must work out differences over their respective roles in fulfilling the accord The Louvre Accord has worked very well in terms of stabilizing exchange rates he said in response to a question during an American Stock Exchange conference here He said exchange rates have been stable so far in 1987 as a result of the accord Swiss Banking Commission hopes to introduce a major reform of the banking system in January which would revolutionise the workings of the country's unusual liquidity requirements Commission Director Kurt Hauri told the main consequence of the change would be an end to the sharp rise in interest rates which occurs at the end of every month By effectively reducing liquidity requirements it would also help Swiss banks compete better against those in Britain West Germany and the United States he said The commission wants to move to a system of average liquidity requirements where banks have to hold reserves equivalent to a certain proportion of their exposure calculated over the month as a whole The current system described as a Swiss special case by Hauri forces banks to comply with requirements generally only at the end of each month The result is a sharp upward trend in short dated money market rates overshadowed by the approach of the end-month called the ultimo with consequent high costs for the banks who are forced to borrow extra funds from the National Bank This was particularly pronounced in June 1986 when overnight rates hit triple figures due to a combination of the half-year end and a rigid adherence by the National Bank to its money supply target Although the rise shocked the bank into more flexibility the problem remained The reform proposal which Hauri said had been planned for years was given to banks and other interested parties for comment on September 30 They have until the end of this month to suggest alterations Subject to such changes and to the government go-ahead it will come into force on January 1 Hauri said AB <ASEAST> said the group to be formed by its merger with Switzerland's BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie <BBCZZ> would have four main business areas; power plants power transmission power distribution and industrial equipment Asea Brown Boveri Ltd's international markets would continue to be run by decentralised management and the three main home markets Switzerland West Germany and Sweden would continue to play an important role Asea said in a statement It said research and development were crucial to the group's future and central reasearch resources and laboratories in the three home markets would be strengthened Louvre accord on currency stability which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since last February appeared in serious danger today as a transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to the boil foreign exchange dealers said But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and bond markets plunged officials in the major industrial countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem between the United States and West Germany and insisted that the currency pact was still alive US Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term interest rates That's not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday He was referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the pact Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan who both have large trade surpluses pledged to boost their economic growth to take in more exports from the US While the US Agreed to stop talking the dollar down However Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre agreement was still operative the West German interest rate move would force the US To re-examine the accord The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that he's going to hammer Germany  He has just declared all bets are off in terms of currency cooperation Chris Johns currency analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine view telling that the exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur who hosted the Louvre meeting was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to respond directly to Baker's remarks He called for a faithful and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British Treasury commented on the row But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre Accord In Frankfurt F Wilhelm Christians joint chief executive of West Germany's largest bank Deutsche Bank said that following recent meetings with Baker he believed that the US Was still committed to the accord In a move which the market interpreted as a possible gesture of reconciliation the Bundesbank added short-term liquidity to the West German money market at 380 pct on Monday down from the 385 pct level at which it injected medium-term liquidity last week The Bank of France also stepped into the French money market to hold down rates injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose close to eight pct Bundesbank will not hold a news conference after its regular fortnightly central bank council meeting on Thursday a spokesman said in answer to enquiries The council is meeting in West Berlin where it meets once a year It also meets once a year in another German city These meetings outside Frankfurt are traditionally followed by a news conference The spokesman declined to comment further In Bonn a finance ministry spokesman said Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg would take part in the meeting in West Berlin His participation was arranged long ago he added West German government assumes that the commitment to international monetary cooperation which was renewed in Washington last month will continue a Finance Ministry spokesman quoted Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg as saying Stoltenberg's statement was a reaction to criticism of rises in West German interest rates voiced by US Treasury Secretary James Baker over the weekend German government sources said Bonn remained committed to the Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies which was struck by leading western democracies in Paris last February Over the weekend US Treasury Secretary James Baker criticised recent rises in West German short-term interest rates and said such developments were not in the spirit of the Louvre pact He said the agreement may have to be re-examined The sources said the West German interest rate rises had to be seen in the context of interest rate developments worldwide sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and matching falls around Europe may have been overdone but the mood on financial markets is precarious Swiss securities analysts and economists said Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening on enormous volume triggered by the slide on Wall Street and the threat of renewed currency instability I have never experienced anything like this and I've been in the business for 20 years said Bernhard Wyttenbach head of European research at Union Bank of Switzerland The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on US Monetary authorities This weekend US Treasury Secretary James Baker publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary policy He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise currencies was still working but added: On the other hand we will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United States will raise rates Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in Zurich said: The situation is very dangerous Statements by the US Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates Herbert Fritschi director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's financial research department called the sell-off overdone but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks loosen their monetary policy I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over he said The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in with an easy money policy or else there is going to be an economic catastrophe They have to act quickly Wyttenbach said the Black Monday sell-off was clearly exaggerated with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction would come soon First the bad news will reach small investors only in time for tomorrow's market when there could be another smaller selling wave As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key -- then we'll get a strong movement upward Wyttenbach said But that may not come soon People are simply worried that in America where the market has now fallen by 18 pct since August the bull market is over he said People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988 Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current problems and the weak dollar Wyttenbach said We do not have a mark problem we have a dollar problem he added but said the biggest culprit was the new chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board Alan Greenspan Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest rates might have to rise As a central banker he shouldn't do that Wyttenbach said There is a danger that we will fall back into the 1970s he said We have a real crisis of confidence in Greenspan I would much rather have a Volcker Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11 Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: I'm relatively optimistic because the situation looks too bad The Fed certainly has to intervene He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take any significant steps adding that the focus of attention remains on the United States The panic started in New York it has to end there The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting they not sell into a panicked market but wait a while before deciding what to do Volkswagen AG <VOWGF> and Ford Motor Co's <F> Latin American joint venture was expected to make losses of 500 mln marks from Brazilian operations in 1987 VW spokesman Ortwin Witzel said He could not comment on a report in the Frankfurter Rundschau daily that Ford might pull out of the venture set up in 1986 to incorporate VW's and Ford's Brazilian and Argentine operations Ford holds 49 pct of Autolatina Witzel blamed Autolatina's losses on Brazil's government price restrictions but said the losses were in line with expectations VW's Brazil unit lost 258 mln marks in 1986 Bank AG joint chief executive Friedrich Wilhelm Christians said he believed the Louvre accord on currency stability was still intact Christians told a news conference he met US Treasury Secretary James Baker in the last two weeks after short term German interest rates had risen twice I am sure that with 17720 marks the dollar is still within the Louvre agreement I do not see that the accord has been terminated Christians said He was responding to questions about comments by Baker who said the Louvre accord was still operative but criticised rises in West German interest rates AG Rudolf Dassler Sport <PUMAF> said it posted a 1987 first-half group loss of about 14 mln marks of which the largest portion was in the US Managing board chairman Armin Dassler told the annual shareholders' meeting parent company turnover was expected to fall to 650 mln marks over the whole year from 6984 mln in 1986 No comparative figure for 1986 first half group loss was available In the whole of 1986 Puma posted a group consolidated loss of 4105 mln marks Dassler said Puma hoped to improve performance in the US This year where heavy losses were mainly responsible for the 1986 deficit He said Puma expected to post a group loss in the second half of this year but the shortfall would be lower than in the first half The same applied to expected parent company losses he added Dassler said Puma had taken measures to improve future performance Dassler said the measures included changing Puma's product range closing down some unprofitable factories in West Germany and France and introducing general cost-cutting He said Puma hoped to break even in 1988 in the US Its most important export market Dassler said a personal payment he would make to shareholders instead of a 1986 dividend was a goodwill gesture which would not be repeated Dassler said the payment to holders of Puma's 280000 non-voting preference shares would amount to about 12 mln marks or 450 marks per share Armin Dassler and his brother Gerd hold all of Puma's 720000 ordinary voting shares They offered the preference shares to the public in July last year Dassler said shareholders would benefit if Puma improved performance next year He did not elaborate Dassler said he and his brother were planning to leave the managing board and join the supervisory board He said he was leaving for health reasons and because he wanted to make way for a new chairman from outside the company His successor has not been made known yet Dassler said today's meeting was expected to approve Manfred Emcke as Puma's new supervisory board chairman replacing Vinzenz Grothgar Otto Poehl head of West Germany's central bank and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank's independence But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl president of the Bundesbank and Stoltenberg over a controversial investment tax proposal has added to the woes of the country's already nervous financial markets bankers said Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's criticism saying West Germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors said one economist for a London broker who asked not to be identified Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market Both Poehl 57 and Stoltenberg 59 have been under extraordinary pressures lately Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy Helmut Schlesinger jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views bankers said Poehl is in a minority in his own house said Commerzbank's Pfister Poehl is in a dilemma He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own said another economist The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far they will attract funds into the country pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October Since last Thursday United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the US And West Germany in which US Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more US Exports One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990 But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for The cool unflappable northerner who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 43 billion marks But it has caused an outcry among bankers who say it will push up borrowing costs The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country's worst political scandal Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein where he heads the ruling CDU party The state's CDU premier Uwe Barschel had to resign after allegations of a dirty tricks election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend Police say the death appears to have been suicide Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this year Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term Werner Chrobok managing partner at Bethmann Bank said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the Bundesbank's independence of government Chrobok said Finance Minister Edouard Balladur issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major industrial countries Balladur responding to weekend remarks by US Treasury Secretary James Baker that the US Would take another look at the accords said I firmly desire a faithfull and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit On Sunday Baker said last week's rise in short-term West German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords The Louvre accords agreed in Paris last February called for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged dollar slide The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance Ministers in Washington last month But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate rise was not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow them he added West German Finance Ministry declined to comment on weekend criticism by US Treasury Secretary James Baker of recent West German interest rate increases Baker said the US Would re-examine the February Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies reached by leading industrial democracies The rise in West Germany short term interest rates was not in the spirit of an agreement by these nations in Washington which reaffirmed the Louvre pact he said A Finance Ministry spokesman asked for an official ministry reaction to Baker's remarks said he could make no comment Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies a senior Bank of Japan official said And US Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews The exchange market is apparently reacting too much and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on the Bank of Japan official told The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down A lower dollar would harm the US Economy he noted A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the US Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 170 and 190 marks The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 17730/35 marks and 14135 yen Behind Baker's remark was US Frustration over higher interest rates abroad especially in West Germany but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord the Finance Ministry official said He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in US Interest rates because it would not only hurt the US Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem Higher US Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress US Stock and bond markets further the monetary officials said Both the ministry and central bank officials who declined to be named noted the US No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the US That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative the senior ministry official said Baker said in a US Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates The market at first interpreted this as indicating the US Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries notably West Germany try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord foreign exchange dealers said But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that the Louvre agreement is still operative and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today the dealers said Uncertainty however remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance or international economic policy coordination The G-7 comprising the US Japan West Germany Britain France Italy and Canada have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply peer pressure to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course they noted Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly the ministry official said The US-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement the official said He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the US On its monetary policy although its short-term money rates have been edging higher This is because we unlike the Germans are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons he added foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the US Dollar will drop below the significant 14000 yen level dealers said The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range If the currency breaks through this level it may decline sharply said Hirozumi Tanaka assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division The dollar was at 14110 yen at midday against Friday closes of 14235/45 in New York and 14135 here The dollar opened at 14095 yen and fell to a low of 14040 It was 17733/38 marks against 17975/85 in New York and 18008/13 here on Friday after an opening 17700/10 The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by US Treasury Secretary James Baker dealers said The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker's comments said Dai-ichi's Tanaka He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in US Bond prices dealers said Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge US Trade deficit Tanaka said US August trade data showed the US Deficit at a still massive 1568 billion dlrs But if West Germany raises interest rates this would run counter to the pledge he said Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention said Soichi Hirabayashi deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange department The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 14000 to 16000 yen dealers said The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively Hirabayashi said He said the US Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon
